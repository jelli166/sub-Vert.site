							<p><i>Three years after running, Ty is finally safe—if he keeps everyone at arm’s length. Working at a Tucson nursery means dirt, heat, and no one asking questions. Then Ben, a 29-year-old designer new to town, steps into Ty’s world and asks him to build something beautiful for his balcony. Ty accidentally starts building a life, too.
									To keep what’s growing between them, Ty has to stop treating love like a threat—and Ben has to stop acting like wanting Ty is negotiable.
							<br><br></i></p>
							<hr>
							<p><br><br>
							Twenty-year-old Ty has spent the last three years drifting between temporary nursery jobs, running from a brutal past in Syracuse. When he lands at the Bella Adobe Nursery in Tucson, he tells himself it's just another three-month gardener gig until the owner Isabella makes it start to feel like home.
											</p><br><p>
												A guy shows up one morning and walks in a project. Ben is twenty-nine, talented, with a quiet confidence. But beneath that charm, he's adrift, going through the motions of a successful career while wondering why nothing and no one feels quite right. When he hires the quirky, sharp-tongued Ty to design some planters for his balcony, neither expects the connection that sparks between them.
							</p><br><p>
												What begins as "hanging out", casual dinners and art gallery visits becomes something neither can ignore. But Ty has spent years protecting his heart, and Ben has never questioned the straight path he was on. As their friendship deepens into something more, both must confront difficult truths: Can Ty trust someone enough to stay? Can Ben figure it all out? What he's feeling?
											</p><br><p>
												In the glow of desert sunsets and mexican food at Ana's Diner, two quiet souls discover that love doesn't always announce itself with a fireworks finale. Sometimes it arrives quietly but with a longing that survives every hurdle. This tender, slow-burn romance explores the courage they both must have, to choose love, with no clear path and when everything seems impossible, until they touch.

							At 22, Sarah is done with college, and done with her father's expectations. Done with everything except escaping her zero life. Her salvation lies halfway across the world, in Vietnam, on her grandfather's sailboat, the Ella Revela.
							<br><br>
							Enter Lucy—a hired Filipina skipper with calloused hands, and zero patience for silly rich girls who can't tie a bowline. Lucy is cold and distant, but she sails Ella with a quiet skill that commands respect. 
							<br><br>
							Forced together on the South Pacific, they're oil and water. But the vast ocean doesn't care, and when Grandpa Ted becomes sick and the storms hit, together, they must figure out how to get Ella to a safe harbor. In the darkness of night watches and endless ocean currents, fear and exhaustion set in, but a bond dawns and pulls them together. Tender moments let them find their way to a connection neither expected. 
							<br><br>
							<i>WARM BLUE WATERS</i> is a contemporary sapphic romance about opposites who must accept, survive, and learn that salvation isn't a destination—it's the person weathering this storm beside you.

<br><br>
<p>	<i>
Meeka thought she had things figured out. Keep your head down, keep your secrets safe, live alone, work at Herb's resort just down the beach, and hang out with Fa, her best and only friend--and barista extraordinaire. Avoid everyone else and never, ever let anyone get close. It's a simple life in a sleepy Thai village—quiet, predictable, safe. Until the day she spills an enormous red slushie all over herself and meets Torn for the first time.
</p><br><p>

He's just passing through. A marine biology grad student from Bangkok, here to finish his thesis at the local research lab. Polite, a little awkward, and frustratingly persistent about showing up at Fa's coffee shop every single day. Meeka tries to ignore him. She's perfected the art of keeping people at arm's length, and she's not about to let some cute guy with messy hair and a kind smile change that. Especially since he doesn't really know Meeka's past, or her beginning. And he carries his own scars and confusion. 
</p><br><p>

But Torn isn't like the others who've drifted through her life. He helps out when Fa's shop gets slammed. He fixes broken things at the resort without being asked. He listens when Meeka talks, really listens, and doesn't expect anything in return. Slowly, against every instinct screaming at her to run, Meeka starts to let him in.
</p><br><p>

Then comes the night of Fa's birthday party. The rain. The kiss that changes everything. And Meeka's absolute certainty that she's about to ruin the best thing that's ever walked into her life.
</p><br><p>
Perfect for readers who love slow-burn romance, found family, and the fringe world of Thailand's third gender, the characters show their courage and risk their hearts before a fateful summer ends.

								Suri has always been an outsider in his own life. Nicknamed “Ikan Pemicu,” the Little Triggerfish, for his ability to navigate Jakarta’s social waters, he’s kept his heart behind a glass wall, certain he’s incapable of the passion his family expects. But when his father’s "business" turns deadly and a forced marriage looms, Suri flees to the rainy streets of Vancouver.
							Stranded and hunted by his father’s hitmen, Suri is taken in by Max, a soulful gay club DJ. What starts as a desperate arrangement, Suri, a shut-in and Max's live-in "houseboy", slowly turns into something much deeper. 
						</p><br><p>Between the scent of spicy sambal in the kitchen and finding that he and Max connect as roomies and then more, Suri’s walls begin to crumble.
							For the first time, Suri isn't just a pawn in his father's crooked world; he’s growing up and discovering his own truth. But with a target on his back, "happily ever after" isn't guaranteed. To claim a future with Max, Suri will have to outsmart a killer and prove that the Little Triggerfish has a bite no one saw coming.
