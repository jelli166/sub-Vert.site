# Ben & Ty v4k
by Kai D. Waddell

## Act 1

### Chapter 1

Rooster Mike screamed.

Ty didn’t need to look to know the red feathered, strutting bastard was right outside his door. And that bird knew exactly what he was doing. Ty lay in his bunk, staring at the plywood ceiling, plotting Mike’s demise.

*Ring around the rosie, pocket full of posies.*

*Rooster Mike's gonna fly, way up in the sky,*

*He’s got a rocket strapped to his thigh,* 

*Gonna fly this Fourth of July.*

Next to his bunk, the red numbers on the old Sony alarm clock glowed 5:47. He’d found a sticker on the bottom: *Made in Japan MFGD 1979*. The thing was twice his age.

Mike hollered again, an extended cockle doodle doo.

*That's it. I am going to strangle the fucker. He picked up his phone to ask google:  “how many firecrackers does it take to dismember a chicken?”*

It was all pointless really, and time to rise and shine. He threw off the covers and swung his legs onto the floor. His bare feet met the cold linoleum.

The room where he was staying was small, dark, and smelled industrial from the fertilizer and deisel oil. It was a walled-off space at the back of a large warehouse. But it was his. No roommates, no bunkmates. Nobody. Just him and the hum of a mini-fridge and the rattle of an ancient window AC. He grabbed a couple of chorizo tamales from the fridge, stood at the counter and munched them down. Next, a shower. He grabbed his towel, put on sandals and a robe, and headed around to the front of the old building. There was a single door to a tiny bathroom and shower. 

Once inside, he wedged a forty-pound bag of sand against the door—the lock was busted—and there was no way he could handle having someone walk in on him. The hot water heater was broken so he got ready for the cold spray. He jumped in and out of the stream: suds up, and rinse, repeat, and out.

Back in his room, he tied his damp, dark hair back into a ponytail though some of it fell around his face. He pulled on his stiff overalls and a loose, old gray long-sleeved shirt. Isabella had given him a floppy sun hat with an enormous brim. He looked like a scarecrow clown. Perfect, all set.

This Tuesday morning, the sky was getting light, brightening at the edges with desert oranges and reds. The big white greenhouse thermometer already read seventy-nine degrees. It would be one hundred by noon.

Isabella was already out in the yard, trailing a long hose down the aisle of hibiscus.

"Good morning, boss."

She turned the spray toward a thirsty shrub. "Hey there, handsome. Did you get some breakfast?"

"The last two tamales."

"Okay, Rose is making more today." She scanned the yard. "Okay, what's the plan today? Can you finish up the Agaves?"

"Sure."

"And then put them up front. Maybe they'll sell."

"Got it."

"And where's your water? Drink a lot all day, okay? I don't want either of you passing out."

"Yes, yes, I'll hydrate. Gotta keep my lovely complexion. And I got my morning ice bath."

She laughed, shaking her head. "So the heater is still out. I can call the guy."

"Don't bother. I want to be low maintenance—so you'll keep me around."

"Sure, Mr. Low Maintenance, let's get busy. A lot going on this week." she teased, spraying a little water near his boots. "And anyway, we keep you around as our diversity hire."

"Oh, I know! I check all the boxes, right?" Ty's tone had some extra sass.

"All of them." She paused over a struggling gardenia. "Sweetheart, grab me the shears?"

Ty jogged to the desk, found them and brought them back. "You know, what am I going to do when there's no one calling me such terms of endearment? Sweetheart, honey, dear? And homemade tamales. Maybe you and Rose should just adopt me?"

"I’d love that. I'll ask her. Then we could get rid of the damn cat. He's so old and can't make it to the litter box." She paused. "You are house-trained, right?"

"Maybe. It depends." 

Isabella laughed. "No matter." She smiled back, the wrinkles around her revealing. "You'll just be our miracle love child." She turned back to the plants, humming the opening notes of the Supremes' "Love Child."

Ty headed to the potting stand and got set up for the rest of the Agaves.  In an hour, the place would feel like a baking sheet. At least he was in the shade for a little while.

### Chapter 2

A Honda Civic beeped in front. Maya hopped out, leaned in to give her girlfriend a kiss, and breezed through the side gate and over to the counter. She tossed her bag down and hit the switch for the ancient desktop and monitor.

"Good morning, people."

Isabella looked up from her papers. "Happy Tuesday."

Ty leaned against the counter, eyeing Maya's empty hands. "Wait. Where's Matcha Mama's coffee?"

"Line was too long." Maya replied.

Ty now looked concerned and turned to Isabella. "Oh no, boss, we're in trouble. Maya without her triple dirty Frap is…  like a day without sunshine—or Charlie without his crack."

Isabella nodded at she checked some paperwork. "Sure, I'll make a fresh pot."

"I don't know." Ty now teased. "That may not be enough. She might need an IV, or a cattle prod." 

Maya narrowed her eyes on Ty, her best vulture glare. "Starting early today, are we?" She peered at his wet hair. "Nice time in the shower? How are those goosebumps?"

"It was brisk. I like it."

Maya continued getting the counter ready, and shook her head, talking to herself. "Weird. This kid's weird." She watched the monitor and POS come to life.

"It’s fine. I like a good jolt in the morning."

"I bet."

Now Isabella exhaled. "You two are too much." She looked up at the big wall clock. It showed 7:02. "Are we ready?"

 Maya yawned. "All set here. And I do need coffee." She grabbed the keys and tossed them to Ty. "Go open the gate, runt."

"Runt?" Ty repeated quietly. "How nice. You know, I know a word that rhymes with...  Oh, never mind." 

He jogged over to main gate and unlocked the chain. He pushed the backstop cinder block aside. The suspended gate slid open. It's metal rollers screeched as a couple of trucks went by. Next, he dragged out an A-frame sign, "Bella Adobe Garden Center", and set it up at the edge of the county road.

He went back to the counter to grab and gloves and water.  Maya was showing Isabella something on her phone. 

"Hey, guess what?" Maya waved him closer.

"What now?” Ty sensed she was up to something.

She turned the screen. The photo showed the three of them standing together in front of the counter. Miguel took the photo last week. It was a nice picture. 

"So I showed this to a friend last night, and she pointed at Ty and said, 'Oh, she's cute. What’s her story? Is she single?'"

Isabella looked closer at the photo. "Really?"

Ty leaned towards Maya, reaching for his gloves. "Bullshit."

Maya ignored him and continued. "Yeah, so I had to tell her, 'So sorry, Chrissy, that girl’s not a girl, but regardlesss, you're not his type. Unless you strap one on.'"

"Maya! That's terrible." Isabella swatted her arm. "And don't be mean to our Ty."

"Oh, please. We all had a good laugh."

Isabella turned to Ty, her expression softening. "Don't listen to her. You’re a sweetheart, with a kind soul and a pure spirit. That's what matters."

"Thank you, boss.” He grabbed his gloves, and pulled down his hat. He turned to Maya. “I’ll deal with you later."

"Kiss, Kiss." She smirked back.

"Bang, Bang." Ty answered back.

Isabella stood there. "You two have your own language."

"I know, right?" Maya smiled. 

A half an hour went by, and Maya brought over a tray of seedlings for Ty to re-pot. A pearly white Range Rover pulled in. The driver ignored the parking spots and stopped in front of the main gate. A forty-ish woman, glitzed out, in bright blue yoga pants, lept out. She was yelling at someone on her phone while her  sunglasses nearly fell off, her arms waving. Her bright lips looked like angry pillows.

Maya stared. "Oh no. Trout pout. She’s all yours." She put down the tray and did a 180. She walk-ran over to the counter and looked very busy.

The woman ended her call and spotted Ty. She called to him, needlessly insistent: "Excuse me! Can you help me, please?"

Ty wiped the dirt off his gloves on the front of his bib and walked over. 

"Sure." 

She stopped, staring at his name tag. There was just a single letter 'T'. This seemed to short-circuit her brain. She pointed at the tag.

"And what’s your name?"

She was actually asking *what are you?*

"It’s Ty."

"Okay, Ty…" She still couldn't figure it out. "I need three of those Ocotillos. The big blue ones. And four bags of the good garden soil. Not the generic stuff, okay? Can you load them in the back? Right away, but be careful. Put some plastic down first. I can’t have dirt in my car. I just had it detailed."

"We don't use plastic," Ty said. "I can get you a tarp and you can bring it back."

"That's too much trouble."

Isabella appeared with a stack of recycled cardboard liners. "We can place the pots in these."

The woman addressed Isabella now, ignoring Ty. "Fine. But tell… her? him? … to be careful. I don't want a mess."

Isabella and Ty shared a look. He shrugged and went for the loading cart.

He got everything loaded and secured. The moment the hatch clicked shut, she was back in the car, on her phone, and peeling out, throwing dust everywhere.music blasting as she peeled away.

"Happy lady," Ty watched the dust plume.

"Charming." Isabella gave a soft head shake and went back to the counter.

Ty grabbed a paper towel from his back pocket and wiped his face. The heat was already rising off the gravel. Maya was with another customer—an older Mexican woman in a sun hat—chatting away in rapid Spanish.

"Is Miguel coming in?" Ty asked Isabella.

"He'll be here Thursday and Friday. We have those saplings and a wedding delivery. Also, by then, the mulch should be here. About ten pallets, so eat your Wheaties."

"Got it." Ty flexed a skinny arm. "Mr. Muscles can handle it! I'm gonna get ripped, right?"

"Doubtful, sweetheart." Isabella smiled to him.

### Chapter 3

Mid-morning and Maya cranked up the volume on a boombox radio and ranchero music blasted across the yard. The nursery lot sat between some open land so there were no neighbors to complain. The oompah bass thumped through dry air. Then the oscillating, baritone DJs screamed away in manic Spanish between jarring car-dealerships and mattress sales.

"I'm going to try and learn Spanish. I took it in high school." Ty yelled over the music to Isabella. He leaned against a stool.

Isabella nodded. "Good idea. You'll pick it up fast. Take the old laptop and watch some videos. But keep it plugged in—the battery's shot."

"Aren't you worried he'll watch porn?" Maya looked up from her work, deadpan.

"Maya, enough." Isabella attempted a look of disapproval.

Ty flashed Maya the finger as he gulped his ice water, and then waved to her. 

"Yeah, that's about what I'd expect from a twelve year old." Maya shook her head, then went and switched the radio to a mellow pop station. "I need a break from this. Shit, it's hot."

Ty was back with the potting, up to his forearms in the potting mix, when gravel crunched near the gate. A pristine, old Tacoma rolled to a stop.

The driver stepped out—trim, corporate, mixed-Asian he guessed, with dark hair a bit long. He wore regular jeans and a fitted shirt. He scanned the yard and saw Ty at the stand.

“Hi, excuse me.” The man’s voice was warm, uncertain. “I’m looking for some plants—actually, a bunch—for planters on a balcony.”

“Of course.” Ty peeled off his gloves. *Great.* He must look like a total hick: dirt-stained, smelling of fertilizer, sweat dripping off his chin under a sombrero-sized straw hat.

He tried to sound professional. “What kind of plants are you thinking about? You said for a balcony?”

“I’m not sure, but it needs to be something I can’t kill. Plants don't seem to last more than a month with me.” The man smiled.

Ty relaxed a fraction. “Ah, so you are one of those: a Grim Flower Reaper, admitting to Floral Abandonment and Planticide.”

The man blinked, startled, before letting out a laugh. “Wow. Okay, yeah, I guess that's accurate. So should I just buy a couple of artificial planters?”

“On a balcony in Tucson? The sun's UV will turn them to dust.” Ty gestured for him to follow. “Whatever you get, you just have to provide some water at least. We can email you weekly reminders.”

Ty led him down the main aisle, pointing out the hardy varieties suitable for large boxes.

"It’s a large balcony, and I haven’t put anything out there. A missed opportunity.” He smiled again. "I'd like something nice to look at when I'm on Zoom calls.”

Ty nodded. "Natives are your best bet: hardy, low-maintenance." Ty stopped in front of a row of flowering shrubs. "These *chuparosa* would be perfect. They bloom almost year-round." He turned, offering a quick smile. "If you water them."

"Chuparosa?" He repeated the word carefully. "That's a pretty name. What does it mean?"

"Hummingbird flower."

Ty looked at the flower as the man reached out, brushing the top of the red bloom with his fingertips. "Gorgeous. Okay then. Let me figure out what I want and I’ll let you know. Is this the right email?” He held up his phone. Ty squinted in the sun to see the screen as the man watched him.

“Yes, that’s it.”

“Great, thank you.”

Ty nodded back. The man headed back to his truck.

### Chapter 4

By late morning, Ty needed a short break and went to the counter. 

Isabella perched on a stool, phone pressed to her ear, stuck on hold with a supplier. Maya sat opposite, decimating a bag of chips. A huge overhead fan whooshed the warm air around. 

She pointed a salty finger at Ty. "What did that guy want? The one in the Tacoma?"

"Wood planters for a balcony."

"You were chatty."

"No. That's called customer service. You should look it up some time."

Maya smirked and crunched another chip. She nudged the donut box on the counter. "Hey, eat that last one."

Ty peered inside. One lonely jelly-filled remained. He shook his head. "Nope."

"Why not?"

"It's got a butthole."

Maya choked and coughed out a chip. "What?"

Ty held up the pastry and pointed to the indentation where the jelly gets  injected.

Maya stared at him. "Are you from fucking Mars?"

Isabella hung up the phone. "What now, you two?"

Maya thumbed at Ty. "Did you know that donuts have buttholes?"

"No, I did not." Isabella sounded weary, looking over the top of her glasses.

"Not all of them!" Ty protested. "Only these, the jelly ones!"

"Show her," Maya ordered.

He held up the donut and pointed to the alleged sphincter.

Isabella sighed, shook her head, and went back to the invoices.

"And Ty has a new friend," Maya announced. "A cute guy was here and they 'connected'."

"You really have a death wish, don't you?" Ty turned to Isabella. "Boss, if I wanted to bury a body, where's a good spot? Out past Marana?"

"Sure." Isabella didn't look up from her paperwork.

"I'm not afraid of you, stick boy. I outweigh you by twenty pounds." Maya rolled up her sleeve and planted her elbow on the counter. "C'mon. *Mano a mano.*" She grinned. "By the way, have you ever had your hormone levels checked?"

Ty glared as he raised himself up.

"Both of you, stop!" Isabella trying to suppress a laugh. "And Maya, that's mean. You can't say that. It's harassment, or something." She looked at Ty. "Dear, please don't report us to the state."

"He wouldn't do that." Maya faltered a moment. "Right?"

"I haven't decided," Ty now sensing an opportunity. He let the question hang a moment and then turned to Maya: "Bring me a double hummer latte every morning for two weeks, and I'll think about it." He grabbed his gloves and hat and strutted off across the lot.

### Chapter 5

Wednesday morning. The alarm broke through a nightmare.

*Darkness. A desolate two pump gas station: dim lights, flickering neon, a buzzing burnt out sign. This was the middle of nowhere and he was standing there, starving, and wearing nothing but a towel, as if he'd just taken a shower. Where the fuck was he? It felt like 2:00 am with no one for miles. And it was cold. Standing at the door, he tried to pull it open. At the top, a little bell jingled. He kept a tight grip on the towel but his ass was hanging out and his bare feet stuck to the greasy, black floor. But he had to eat something. Right Now. He stood in front of the coolers in the back. All the food looked stale and rotten.*

*He grabbed two packaged burritos and headed to the checkout. A fat, greasy man in an A-shirt leered at him. "Let me see it. Are you a girl?" Ty tried to scream. The man yelled back, face contorted, "No shirt, no service! Little faggot, get out!"*

Ty gasped. In bed, in the dark. *Fuck! Nightmares... Where am I? Lying soaked in these old sheets. Okay. Tucson. Isabella's place. Safe.*

He exhaled, heart hammering against his ribs. No one else was in here. He grabbed the side of the bed and held on.

Three years ago. His high school. Syracuse, New York, in November.

Another dumb day at school. It was a Thursday, seventh period. He had Phys Ed. He always waited in the bleachers until everyone was out of the locker room. He didn't want to listen to a bunch of shit while he got dressed. And he was in and out. His last period was homeroom, so who cared if he was a few minutes late. All dressed now, he headed out the short hallway to leave. Something moved behind him, and a pair of gorilla arms locked him down. In a vice, he was lifted off his feet. Ty struggled, twisting around. He saw who it was: Matt Fuller, the captain of the wrestling team and an enormous, arrogant asshole. And one of Ty’s main tormentors. One of his massive paws was clamped over Ty's mouth. Was he fucking around?

“Stay quiet, bitch!” He hissed in Ty’s ear. His breath stunk. This didn’t feel like a joke.

Matt carried him back into the locker room. The door to the supply closet was open. Ty kicked and tried to yell.

"Shut the fuck up, pussy." Matt’s sweaty face pressed hard into Ty’s bare neck.

He heaved Ty into the dark, tiny room, and Ty fell into the shelving. The door slammed shut. Darkness, illuminated only by the thin slice of light under the door. But Ty could still see this guy’s face and his eyes: crazy, hungry, hate.

"I've got something for your skinny little ass."

Matt punched him in the gut. Ty buckled; air vanished from his lungs.

"Stop!" Ty wheezed.

Matt punched him in the face.

"You sound just like a little bitch. Come here!" He grabbed Ty's hair, forcing his head down toward his crotch. "You like this, right?" With his free hand, Matt shoved his sweatpants down. "Jesus, I'm hard!"

Ty scrambled. He grabbed a shelf for leverage. Matt yanked his hair harder. Ty’s right arm came free.

He drove his fist into Matt's balls.

Matt didn't let go. Ty hit him again. Harder. This time he made contact.

Matt cursed, gave a loud grunt, and went fetal, falling over against the wall.

Ty broke free and lunged for the door. He burst into the hallway, vision blurred by tears. He flew across the courts. A freshman gym class stopped to watch him.

"What the hell!" some teacher yelled at him.

Ty made it to the side doors, not looking back, and sprinted around the side of the building. He waited there a few minutes, trying to catch his breath and stop his sobbing. No one seemed to be coming. He sprinted next to the bus garage. He waited another minute and then ran for the woods.

His backpack was still in the locker room. *Leave it.* He wasn't going back. He cut through the woods to a side street, checking over his shoulder every ten yards. Report it? No point. The dean would blame him. Matt’s parents owned the car dealership. They were royalty. Untouchable. Ty was nothing.

But he was done.

If he stayed, Matt and his friends would be waiting tomorrow, or the day after. He was dead. Seriously, this time they’d kill him.

Ty reached his street and made it to his house and crept in the front door. His dad, like always, was in the back room, Fox News blasting. Ty stuffed clothes into a gym bag. He took his summer cash stash—a couple hundred bucks—and slipped out the back door.

The 8:10 p.m. Greyhound to Cleveland.

He texted Kenny: *I got attacked. Matt Fuller this time. I'm leaving.*

He took a selfie and sent it to Kenny.

*Post this on my Instagram tonight, okay? Then delete the account.*

It seemed like a hundred years ago. There was Cleveland, Michigan, Chicago, Rockford, and Madison. Every stop put more distance between him and that locker room.

### Chapter 6

Thursday, 6:00 AM. Ty rolled over and silenced the alarm before the second beep. No rooster, no dreams, just the gray light of a workday. 

Mr. Mike had not been around for 3 mornings now. Maybe a coyote had got him? Aww no, that would be bad news. Sure, plenty of mornings he’d wanted to throttle that rooster, especially at four AM, but other times, he was entertaining. So we don't want him *that* dead. That dead? More or less dead? Dead is dead. It's a light switch, on or off; but how about if it's a slider?  An axis. Zero to breathing and back to zero. A bell curve. Why not make it a spectrum? Wavelengths or frequencies loosely defined states with no clear boundaries: alive-ish, mostly alive, door nail. 

He started at the plywood above his bunk. He felt like he had the waves and grains and knots memorized, but we went back to death as non-binary. To joing all the other spectrums explaining humans. ASD. ADHD. Cognitive alphabet soup, was it Dissonance or Distortion? Whatever. He'd run into them all as a kid, tested for, and labeled with this or that. Same impulse: nothing clean, nothing clicks neatly into place. And now gender, identity, orientation.

Still—none of that answered the real question. Rooster Mike was maybe gone. Expired. Or just off gallivanting elsewhere. Ty hoped he would be around again soon.

That morning at Bella Adobe Nursery and Garden Center skated by. Ty was working at the back of the lot with Miguel. The old ex-hippie was a pro with the Bobcat, spinning the machine on a dime to lift pallets of mulch before reversing and setting them gently by the stacks. Just the constant repetition of the Bobcat’s engine and the beeping as it reversed. Ty worked the ground game, unloading the bags and wrestling massive terra cotta pots into rows. He was soaked with sweat but he actually liked this kind of work. He’d be weary but relaxed, and he’d take a quick shower before he ate lunch.

When Miguel and Isabella left for the midday deliveries, the silence of the desert settled over the yard. Heat radiated off the gravel, thick with the smell of dry earth. Ty wiped a smear of grit and sweat from his forehead and headed for the shade of the counter.

Maya had finished her lunch and was working over at the big potting bench. Ty checked the clipboard for scheduled jobs and unscrewed his water bottle when the dark gray Tacoma from Monday pulled.

*Well, okay, he’s back.* 

Ty dumped a little water on his towel to wipe his face, stalling, and pulled off his big, ugly hat. Well, at least this time he wasn’t pitted out. By the time he looked up, the guy was standing a ways back, waiting for Ty to look up. 

“Hi again,” the man said.

“Oh. Hi.” Ty took a slow swig from his water bottle to buy a second of silence, never sure what to do with his hands when just standing there. He managed a smile. “Welcome back.”

Ty winced. *Shit, I sound like a flirt.*

The guy stood there a moment, shifting his weight. He seemed to be searching for an opening. “Say, I wanted to ask... just wondering…  do you know where I can get wooden planters?  Custom ones, I'm thinking of something low profile but fairly long. They'd be heavy. I've found some photos online that are close to what I'm thinking. Is that possible to have done?"

Ty nodded a bit and had to smile. The guy was nervous. It was cute.

"I remember you asking about that," Ty said, leaning back against the counter. "I mentioned it to Isabella, the owner. She said it was no problem—we have a local carpenter we use. But she's out on an appointment right now."

"That's okay. She seems busy." He glanced around the empty yard. "Could someone else help? How about you?" Again, the strain in his voice. He was trying hard to be casual.

Ty nodded, wanting to be easy-going. "Maybe. I'm not sure." He paused. "I'm new here. So let me ask her."

The guy seemed reassured. "That’s okay. No rush.”

"Alright, sure, we'll let you know."

The man stepped forward, extending a hand. "Great. By the way, I’m Ben. Ben Nakamura." He glanced at the grimy nametag pinned to Ty’s chest.

“Nice to meet you. I’m Ty.”

“I wondered what the T stood for.”

Ty looked down. The plastic tag was chipped again. “Oh. The 'Y' fell off again. No wonder that lady asked if I was Tina or Theresa.”

“Oh. Really?”

"Yeah." Ty shrugged. "It's fine. Takes all kinds. I'm used to it." He smiled at Ben, the adrenaline of social anxiety suddenly making him chatty. "Yep, that's me. Missing the ‘Y’. Like I am missing the ‘why’.” He waved a hand vaguely at the sky. “Or the... why what? Like, why get up in the morning?"

He caught himself, the words spilling out too fast. "Or wait—maybe a Y chromosome? Yes!"

Ben's expression blanked out.

Ty felt the heat rush up his neck. "Sorry. I sound like I'm disturbed. Or possessed."

But then Ben laughed. "No, no, you’re fine. That was… funny." He turned toward the aisles of greenery. "If it's okay, I'll just look around. I want to check out those over there."

"Sure. Take as long as you like. Let us know if you have any questions.”

Ten minutes later, boots crunched on the gravel again. Ben hesitated at the counter, then reached into his pocket. "I think I see some I like. I'll do some research now." His expression was tight but he reached into his shirt pocket. "Can I give you my card? Then you call or text me? That way I'll have your number. I mean, so I can send you the measurements."

Ty looked at him, surprised by the directness. "Sure." He grabbed a pen and one of the nursery flyers and scribbled his cell number near the bottom margin. He handed it to Ben. “I’ll talk to Isabella and let you know. Nice to meet you."

"Nice meeting you. Thanks."

Ty watched him walk back to his truck, the gray paint gleaming under the harsh sun.

Maya appeared at his elbow so quietly he jumped. 

"Business or pleasure, Romeo?" 

Ty didn't look at her. "Don't start. It was business. I only do business." 

"Very tempting, but I won’t touch that one. Anyway, that's not what my Spidey Sense was saying." 

"Your Spidey Sense can go snuff itself." Ty glowered at her a moment, then smirked and walked off, back to the stacks.

---

An hour later, Ty heard the nursery’s big flatbed truck rumble in through the back gate. Isabella and Miguel came up to the counter. They looked tired.

Miguel said a quick hello, grabbed a soda, and waved to everyone. "Later, muchachas." He was done for the day and heading home.

Maya chuckled as she sorted some labels and price tags, then she looked at Isabella. “That guy came back looking for Ty,”

Ty gave her an annoyed look. "He wasn't looking for me."

"Oh, the cute guy from Monday?" Isabella asked, as she checked messages.

"Jesus, you two are so nosy!" Ty spun away on the stool.

Maya grinned, leaning her hip against the wood. "That's right, bitch. I am your nosy queer big sister. Here to make sure you're safe until your Prince Charming rides in to town.”

"God help me. Maya's fairy tales. Marvelous." Ty rolled his eyes toward the ceiling fans.

Isabella steered them back to reality. "So, what did he want?"

"He wants some custom planters. Wood ones."

"Okay. Does he know sizes and how many? We can have Tony build them. So sure, we can do that. You want to work on it?"

Ty shrugged, feigning indifference. "If that's okay, sure. He said he'd send us measurements and some photos. He'll also want them planted of course."

Isabella nodded. "Okay, once we get that, we can see what he's thinking."

That afternoon, Ty was hauling the last of the pots when his phone buzzed against his hip. He wiped his hands on his overalls before pulling it out.

A text from the new contact. No playful emojis, just business. Attached were photos and a file with dimensions.

Ty walked over to where Isabella was sorting invoices in the shade. "Okay, here's what he sent."

Isabella peered at his phone screen. She zoomed in on the floor plan, then scrolled through the photos. "Wow. Nice. Ask him to email these. You and I can sit down tomorrow and go over them."

"Will do."

### Chapter 7

Friday morning, Ty walked out first thing and headed over to the counter where Isabella was going through some printouts.

"Mr. Nakamura sent an email," Isabella said. "Let's take a look."

She spread out the sheets containing notes and a balcony layout, then grabbed a pad of graph paper. "Let's get our bearings." She sketched quickly—drainage layers, gravel depth, soil composition. "You want the planter to balance with the plant. Account for growth. Don't let one plant overtake the others, above or below the soil. You can't put a shark in with a goldfish."

“Like what?” Ty got lost on that last one.

"Sure, Certain types of bamboo, willow, and a few of the balms. Look up anything with 'aggresive rhizomes'."

She tapped the laptop screen, pointing to Ben’s sample photos. "See how minimalist these are? That's what he wants. Low profile and modern. And these tall tapered cylinders. So he will have both vertical and horizontal shapes. This could look nice."

She handed Ty a ruler. "You sketch it out. Calculate the volume in cubic feet. I'll check your math. How did you do in Geometry?”

“Aced it.” He smiled and took the ruler. "I actually had good grades." By mid-morning, he had a bunch of rough drafts.

Isabella looked over his shoulder. "Good start! Can you reduce the width here? And let’s give these edges a slight rounding. Try one more. And we'll go over it tomorrow."

That evening, just at sunset, Ty walked down to Ana's Diner. He had his sketchpad tucked under his arm. The heat had finally broken, leaving the sun to tint the foothills in sepia and orange.

The diner was quiet. A quiet couple, mid-thirties, sat in one of the side booths. Ana stood behind the counter, cleaning a cooler case and the coffee maker.

"Hey, stranger." She grinned. "Where you been? Haven't seen you since…?"

"Monday?" Ty slid onto a stool.

Ana poured him water without asking. "Sounds about right. You're going to sit at the counter?"

"Yeah."

She called the order back to the cook, then leaned her elbows on the counter, eyeing the pad. "What's that?"

"Planter designs. For a customer at Isabella's."

"Look at you. All professional."

Ana brought out a big plate of chicken in a dark brown sauce, joined by rice, beans, shredded lettuce and tomato. Along side was a covered dish with warm tortillas. The wonderful smell of the spiced chocolate Mole sauce rose up. At first, he ate slowly, sketching between bites. Ana brought him another can of Coke. Behind him, the door chimed as the couple left. Like usual, he was the last customer. Ana seemed to like having him there as she finished up with things, moving around to the empty tables and humming along with the radio.

He finished up. He did not want to have her wait to close for him. The walk back to the nursery was cool, the air filled with the buzz of cicadas. He slipped through the side gate, crossing the dark rows of plants toward the floodlights near the barn.

Back in his room, he tossed the sketchpad on the table and downed a glass of cold water. What to do? There was more he could do with the sketches. But he felt distracted. From the project or the client Ben? It had better be just the project. 

He was happy that Isabella was letting him work on it. I mean, he had no training in such things, although these were just shapes—cubes and rectangles. He went over to the table and sat back down with his pencil and ruler. He visualized the photos that Ben had sent and then thought about the way he had walked through the aisles of plants and flowers. The way Ben paused, staring at random things—a leaf, a pot, a shadow. He looked at things like he could ponder them endlessly, even sink into them.

*Look at me. Sheesh. There I go again. Elliptical orbit. Just circling. In Earth’s lower orbit, do you know how much space junk there is? Screws, spent rockets, paint chips, dead satellites, all of it traveling at thousands of miles a second. How?* 

*And why? My dad—back when he was still a human, so when I was seven—had a favorite saying when I'd spiral: "Full count, a runner on second, and the Babe hits one outta here. There it goes, ladies and gentlemen, over the left field wall." That's me. Outa here, over the left field wall.*

The rest of the week, Ty kept at the planter plans. He’d meet with Isabella in the morning and they'd go over the changes he'd made. She’d take a look, chat a bit,  and then make suggestions on what to try or fix. 

By Saturday, they agreed that the options, sketches, and specs looked good and she said they were ready to go. Ty sent the email and ten minutes later, his phone buzzed.

*Ty, these look great. Can we get together and discuss them?*

Ty stared at the screen until the backlight dimmed. 

A meeting? In person? *Why?* Were the drawings wrong? Did he need to explain anything? Or what?

His thumb hovered over the keypad. He typed *Do you have a question? Is something wrong?,* but then he backspaced and deleted it all. His brow furrowed. He didn't want to seem difficult. He wanted to seem professional.

*Sure,* he typed, before he could make too much of it. *Monday works.*

### Chapter 8

Normally, Ty didn’t like Mondays. There was not much to do with the place closed. He usually took a walk, but aside from Ana's and a little convenience store, there wasn't anything close.

He did like to stay up late on Sunday nights. He'd sit and sketch weird shit, abstracts, distorted creatures or stylized landscapes and faces—while K-pop and grunge blasted from a little bluetooth speaker. When he got tired, he lie in bed and watch an old black and white movie until he fell asleep.

But this Monday, he had a “business” meeting. *Yeah, right.* Anyway, he arrived at Ana's at 10:55. He’d actually put it in his calendar app: "11 a.m. Project Meeting with Balcony Guy." "Balcony Guy" was safer than "Ben," and "Mr. Nakamura" felt like a character from a stage play. He smoothed the front of his generic white T-shirt—fresh out of the wrapper—and checked his jeans. The only pair he had that weren’t beat to shit. He reached the front door, checked his reflection and walked in. 

He was sitting in the back booth—Ty’s booth—looking a bit too urban (and handsome) for the diner's decor. Ben was reading something on his phone, brow furrowed, scrolling, that look of someone currently lost in a spreadsheet.

Ty walked over. "Hi. You're in my seat."

Ben looked up, blinking. It took him a second to travel from wherever he had been back to Ana's Diner. He recovered with a wave. He hadn’t caught the joke.

"Thanks for coming," Ben said. "I got you coffee. Is that okay?"

Ty looked at the steaming mug. "Perfect." He slid into the opposite bench, keeping a careful distance from the table edge. "Sorry, have you been waiting long?" This felt weird.

"No, you're on time. So, it's your day off?"

"Yeah. No problem."

Ben nodded and opened his laptop and turned it so they could both see. He scrolled through the sketches a few time. And then through the specs from the email. He went back to the sketches and pointed, "I think I like this one." He pointed to the low-profile platform design.

"Good. That was Isabella's favorite, too. And the sizes seem okay?"

"Yes. And I saw your note about irrigation. I don't plan to have water pipes installed outside. I doubt the building would even let me. As we talked about, I'll just try and be diligent. Change my ways from… what did you call it? Planticide?"

"Right. We’ll send emails and you can add it to your calendar.

"Yes, I'll stick to it. I plan on turning over a new leaf…" Ben abruptly stopped. "Oh. Sorry. Dumb pun."

Ty gave a quiet smile. "No, no, it's okay."

Ty relaxed, leaning back against the vinyl booth. He watched Ben scroll through the other images. Probably he should be looking elsewhere, but too bad. Anyway, he shook himself a bit and focused back on the laptop.

"So," Ty said. "If you're set on the design, I'll let Isabella know and she'll contact the woodworker for a quote."

"Fine by me. When will you need a deposit?"

"Talk to Isabella for that. I'm just Clancy the gardener."

"Sure, great. So you'll add in the plants and everything?"

"Yep. Again, Isabella will tell me what needs to be done.”

"Sure, sounds good. I appreciate you doing this." Ben nodded. He closed the laptop.

“It's great. The first time I've done planters so I'm learning a lot.” Ty started to gather up the papers, get ready to leave.

"Hey," Ben said. "If you're not busy... can I buy you lunch?"

Ty paused. "No, no, you don't have to do that."

"I know. I'm just offering. I'm going to stay and order something."

Ty looked at him. "Are you sure?"

"Of course."

"Okay then. I guess. Then you won't have to eat alone."

"Right," Ben smiled. "Although I usually eat alone."

"Me too."

"It’s ‘lunch for the loners’ then. Have you eaten here before?"

Ty suppressed a smile. "I eat here just about every night. Ana is sick of me. I don’t tip.”

Ben laughed, a warm, genuine sound. "Then what do you recommend?"

"Pollo con Mole."

"Perfect."

Ty went to the counter to tell Ana. When he returned, Ben leaned forward. "How long have you worked at the nursery?"

"Just a month. I've only been in Tucson that long."

"Really? Where were you before?"

"Wisconsin. Chicago. Louisville. Michigan. Cleveland." Ty listed them off like train stops. "I'm just hopscotching around. Have been for a while."

"What? Really? How old are you?"

"Twenty."

Ben's eyebrows shot up. "No way."

"What? So I look older? Or younger?" Ty didn't wait for a response. "Anyway, I grew up in western New York—Syracuse. I left three years ago." He kept his voice light, carefully neutral. "I kind of ran away. Just took off. I went to Cleveland and got a job at a flower nursery. That's it. I've just been working seasonal gigs as a landscaper or gardener or whatever. I worked a couple of months on a blueberry farm in Michigan. That was fun."

"You left home at seventeen?"

"Yeah." Ty tapped his fingers on the table. "Problems. School, family. The usual."

Ben nodded. He didn't press. "Sounds rough."

"Yep. But I'm doing okay, getting by. No longer on the run." Ty raised a brow to underline the joke. "And it's been good here. Isabella is wonderful. She's my new mom. This place is nice. Maybe I'll stick around."

"Good to hear. I hope so too."

"I'm learning a lot," Ty continued, eager to shift the topic. "She gets into the science of it. Plants and climate here are totally different from the Midwest. It's cool."

Ben studied him. "And the sketches... did you do those?"

"Yes."

"They're very good. Where did you learn?"

"I've always done that. Always with my sketchbook. Got in trouble in school for doodling instead of listening." Ty shrugged. "Took some art and drafting classes. You know, gay boys gonna be artistic. It's my therapy. Keeps me off of the horse tranq and industrial Prozac."

He waited for Ben to flinch.

Ben just smirked. "Yeah. Okay. Sure." He shook his head, smiling. "I wish I was half as mature as you at twenty."

"You're funny. I'm sure you've always had your shit together."

"Nice of you to think so. I guess I put up a good front."

*Okay,* Ty thought. *We covered enough of my past—without stepping on any landmines.*

Ana arrived with the food. She set the plates down, glancing between Ty and the well dressed man. "Here you go."

"Ana, this is Ben," Ty said. "He's a customer at Isabella's."

"Oh, really? Okay." She gave Ben a look that said *I'm watching you*, then softened. "Well, enjoy, boys. Need more coffee?"

"We're good, thank you," Ben said.

They dug in.

"What about you?" Ty asked between bites. "You mentioned you moved from Denver."

"Yep. Here for a project. At least a year. We have a big client in town and I need to meet them regularly. I hate flying and it was a good time for a change. So far, I like it."

"Just you?"

"Like married or a significant other? Nope. Just me." Ben laughed. His eyes smiled again. "Thinking about getting a dog, though."

They finished eating, Ben wiping his plate clean with a tortilla. "Want to get going?"

"Yep," Ty said. "Thanks again."

### Chapter 9

The next day, Isabella confirmed Ben's order.

"Carpenter says three to four weeks to make the planters. He's got to order the wood. Congratulations, your first project."

Ty was back in his room at noon, taking a break from the sun. His phone buzzed. A text from Ben.

*Hey, can we meet?*

Ty stared at the screen. *Is there a problem with the order?* he typed back.

Ben's reply came, *No, no, sorry, just on Monday. If you're busy, that's okay.*

Ty typed back, *No, not busy.*

*Okay, I wanted to eat at that place again. Ana's? It was good.*

Ty smiled and typed back, *And you don't want to eat alone, right?*

*LOL, okay, you caught me.*

Ty lowered the phone, his brow furrowed. He didn't want to overthink it. Yes, Ana's Mole was epic, but was there something else?

*Okay,* he typed.

The rest of the week dragged by. The glare of the sun had Ty’s shirt stuck to his back after half an hour. There were not too many customers, but he kept busy with the potting and pruning. The nursery hummed with its usual rhythm—Maya bitching about the heat, Isabella humming along to the radio, the occasional customer wandering in for a potted shrub or a bag of garden soil, and a new supply of tamales from Rose.

### Chapter 10

Most of the day Monday, he just relaxed. The nursery yard was quiet under the full sun. How did plants handle this climate? I mean, he knew it was a dumb question, but everything was so different in the Midwest. He had checked with Isabella to see if she wanted him to do some extra watering.

Monday, just before 3:00 PM, Ty headed out the door. He left through the side gate and headed to the diner. Ben was already waiting out front when Ty walked up.

The place was empty. Ana had some piano jazz playing quietly from a speaker, adding to the lull of a Monday afternoon. Ty could hear her in the kitchen.

"Hola, Ana!" Ty called out. "It's me and a friend."

"Ty?" Ana's voice came loud from the kitchen. "Hi, honey! I'll be out in a couple of minutes. Grab a seat!"

Ty grabbed a menu, and they slid into the same booth. The vinyl squeaked under Ty as he slid in across from Ben.

"So," Ty started, hands resting on the table. "What's new?"

"Not much. Thanks for coming. Just thought we could grab lunch again. You know, just not eat alone. Anyway, thanks."

“Sure. So let's split the bill, or let me pay."

"Nope. No way. I invited you.”

"Okay, fine. Are you still happy with the designs?"

"Of course. Can't wait." Ben’s voice was quiet.

"So you must be planning to stay there awhile, right? Those planters won't be easy to move once they're there."

"Yep, that's true. And sure, anything could happen. I could get sent to Seattle. Or wherever. But I want this place to feel like home. I rented a little studio apartment in Denver, and I got sick of it. The place was so small and generic." Ben paused and looked up. "Anyway, everything’s good. How about you?"

Ty gave a small smile, feeling Ben’s gaze on him. "Standard old, standard old. Sun comes up, sun goes down, and while it's up, it's turning me into an alligator purse."  

Ty flipped his phone, illuminating a Modigliani portrait—long neck, eyes just vacant holes. The air felt thin, without blueprints or sketches between them.

"So how's work?" Ty asked.

"Not much. Our client here in town can be a pain in the ass." Ben winced. "Sorry. That wasn't very professional."

Ty laughed and teased. "I'm offended, Ben. Truly. It's not very Ivy League of you."

Ben gave a short laugh. "Yes, that's me, Ivy League." He seemed to relax a bit. He picked up the menu. Ty watched him. A strand of dark hair fell over his forehead; Ben smoothed it back with a quick, careless motion.

"Do you want a beer?" Ty asked.

"Huh? Really? Sure, sounds good."

Ty slid out of the booth and walked to front and behind the counter and grabbed two Modelo's from the cooler. 

"I'm grabbing beers!" Ty called out to the kitchen

"Okay!" Ana yelled back above the clattering. "I'll be out in a minute." 

“Self-service?” Ben asked as Ty sat back down, managing this time not to squeak his butt on the vinyl.

“Didn't you know? I work here as a waitress too." Ty gave a smirk. "Buy local, and be sure to tip."

The words hung in the air.

*Shit.* Ty thought. *That was a bit too gay.* He tried not to look freaked. 

"Sorry," Ty muttered, staring at his beer. "I mean waiter. I'm the waiter."

Ben smiled. He had a warm, amused expression. "Not to worry."

Ty exhaled, his chest relaxed. "Right. Okay." He took a long drag on his beer. "Okay then. So. What about you? Where did you grow up? School? Brothers, sisters? Give me the dossier."

Ben laughed as Ty shifted around in his seat. "Okay, okay. Sure." He nodded at Ty’s phone. "Modigliani? École de Paris, right?"

Just then, Ana came out of the kitchen, dish towel in hand. "Okay, sorry about that! I have to keep stirring this damn pudding. So what can I get you two?"

Ty let Ben answer. "I'd like the Pollo con Mole. Like the last time."

"Sure." Ana spun her head. "And you, troublemaker?"

"How am I a troublemaker? Anyway, yes, the same—that's easy, right?"

"Of course. Give me ten minutes, okay? And grab another beer." She wheeled around and hustled back to the kitchen.

Ty exhaled, then recoiled a bit. Was that too much? He glanced down at his phone. "So you know some art history too?”

"A bit. Are you a fan?" Ben nodded.

Ty reacted again. "Whoa, that sounds funny, like  'are you a fan of Amedeo Modigliani?' Like asking if I'm a fan of Taylor Swift or Bad Bunny… or Chicago deep-dish pizza."

Ben laughed. “Okay, fine. Yes, we can't mix fine art with pop culture. But anyway, yes, I like Modigliani. Great stuff, although he had a crazy life, as seemed to be the custom back then.”

“Yep, true. But I don't know. Seems like a lot of artists specialize in bad decisions.” Ty was looking past Ben to the TV, his fingers tapping the bottle.

Ben watched him. “A random thought, but why do I feel like Modigliani and twentieth-century art are not typical topics of conversation in this diner?"

Ty gave a little side glance. "You don’t know that. This place could be a hotbed of obtuse intellectual discussions."

Ben now raised his brow. "A hotbed?"

Ty was having fun. "Yes, a hotbed. Ana is planning to change the decor here and put up fine Renaissance etchings and Toulouse-Lautrec posters. She'll bring in the local starving artist crowd.”

“And they don't tip?" Ben played along well.

"Yes, they are shitty tippers." Ty nodded in confirmation.

"Just ask the waitress. I mean, waiter."

Silence followed for a moment. Ty looked at Ben and he could tell Ben wasn't sure if he had crossed the line. Ty gave a little smile and nodded back, "Yes, just check with that person."

Ben's eyes were bright now. "The bigger question one might ask: how does a lowly prairie gardener care to know so much about French painters?”

“He was Italian.”

“Fine, yes, Ty, he was Italian. A point for you. But he was at the École de Paris at the same time as Picasso, Chagall, and Soutine. He did most of his paintings while in Paris." Then Ben added. "And you did not answer the question.”

"Sure, fine. A kid from the crappy part of Syracuse shocks everyone, knows his Fauves from his futurists. My mom was an art history major. And she liked the Impressionists and everything before and after. My favorites were an earlier group—Matisse, Derain, Vlaminck. I remember the paintings, but I get the terms mixed up."

"The Fauves," Ben nodded.

Ty smiled. "Wow, okay, show off. Those guys. Anyway, my mom had books and videos. And we’d watch documentaries. We’d go to the museum with Uncle Lou.”

"Uncle Lou?"

"Yes, he wasn’t really an uncle—a family friend. Oh, not really, just my mom’s friend. My dad couldn't stand him."

"Why?"

"He was gay. That was enough. But he and my mom were best friends. Since college."

### Chapter 11

Ana came out of the kitchen carrying two platters. "Here you go! Ty, be a doll and grab the tortillas and the silverware. As you can tell, I am solo here."

"Will do!" Ty jumped up and brought everything from the counter.

They dug in and the conversation was paused.

Ty felt the silence and so between bites, he spoke up. "And you? Have you always lived here?"

Ben finished his last tortilla. “No, no. I grew up in San Diego. My dad's American-born Japanese; my mom's Danish. Well, sort of. My grandparents are in Munich now, but she was born here."

“A Euro-Asian.”

"I guess. For all the labels are worth.”

“So what do your parents do?”

“My dad's an electrical engineer. He works for Rockwell."

“Never heard of them.”

“It's a big defense contractor.”

"And your mom?"

"She's got her own business doing interior design. It's a small shop, like a boutique. She and my aunt, her twin sister, run it. My aunt handles the office, the paperwork. My mom works with the clients. She's the Alpha.”

Ty laughed. “So, any brothers or sisters?”

“Nope. How about you?"

"One older sister. She's still back in Syracuse. How did you end up here?”

Ben traced the condensation on his beer bottle. "I was in Denver for a while after college. Left for a year to finish my master's in Japan.”

"So what kind of work do you do now?"

"Visual. Branding, UI, UX. I’ve been with this company about three years. We landed a big client here in Tucson, and they wanted someone in town."

"You like it?"

"I like Tucson. It's quieter than Denver. Less... showy. The client here is a complete nutjob.”

Ty polished off his plate and leaned back. "Can I see some of your work?"'

"It's on my website. Mostly old stuff. I'll send you the link later."

"Send it now."

"No." Ben grinned.

"Fine." Ty scowled playfully, returning to his phone. He pulled up an image. "Here. David Hockney."

"Swimming pools," Ben said, nodding. "Great stuff. I have a book of his. I’ll bring it for you sometime. I have one of his *New Yorker* covers in my hallway."

Ben paused. He looked at Ty, gaze steady. "Hey. Would you like to go to dinner sometime?"

Ty blinked. "Sure. I guess." He rubbed the back of his neck. "I don't really do anything around here. Just work and sleep."

"There's a Tex-Mex place, El Rancho Rancho. Have you been?"

"Nope. Funny name." Ty swirled the last of his beer. "Can I change it?"

"I guess. If it makes you happy."

"Rancho Rauncho?”

Ben nodded, a big smile. "Rancho Rauncho. Definitely. I like it." He leaned in, lowering his voice. “Let’s pitch them a marketing campaign. The slogan: 'Get Raunchy at the Rancho.'"

---

Ty hummed some Sublime as he walked back toward the nursery, hands shoved in his pockets. The night air had cooled. He and Ben had sat there almost three hours. He stopped at the corner, glancing back toward Ana’s Diner. The lights were still on inside but she’d be locking up soon. When was the last time he’d actually hung out like that? Just talking and joking around. Not since forever.

The realization settled on him. He had turned into a weirdo near-hermit. It was worse in other places. At least here he had Maya and Isabella. So this had been fun.

He reached the side gate and let himself in. The large open yard always felt so still with all the thriving plants. The dark warehouse building at the back, just a single flood light around the side.

His room was stuffy, so he turned the AC up. His last sketches sat on the dinette table. He sat down, staring at them but not thinking. The problem was he liked the guy. Liked talking to him. Liked the way Ben listened, the way he smiled when Ty made some dumb joke. The way he’d leaned in at the end, lowering his voice.

*Get Raunchy at the Rancho.*

Ty smiled for a moment, but then a wave of emptiness washed over him. He shuddered and squeezed his eyes shut. Fuck, this was yanking him around. Time to take a big step back, sister.

He stood up, peeled off his shirt, and tossed it onto the chair. Then, he laid down with his phone.

*I have to be careful. Keep some distance. This guy's not dumb, not for a straight guy. And he didn't freak out with the waitress thing.*

Just friends.

He could do that.

### Chapter 12

The week moved along with occasional surge of customers and mostly just potting, transplants, mulch bagging, and deliveries. One morning he lost a fight with a cactus that refused to be re-potted. Whatever day that was, he just focused on Thursday night and dinner at the Raunchy.

On Tuesday, Miguel had brought in half a ton of river rock. Maya seemed cranky in the heat and threatened to quit about every hour. Isabella just hummed around. The lady had such karma.

Ty texted Ben to ask what time to be there. That afternoon, Isabella found Ty dragging hoses across the back lot.

"Go clean up," she said. "You've got plans tonight, right?"

"It's just dinner."

"Uh-huh." She waved him off. "Go. You smell like a cow pie."

Ty showered fast, scrubbing the grit from under his nails. He pulled on clean jeans and a faded black t-shirt, then checked himself in the mirror. His hair was getting long. Maybe he'd chop it back. He grabbed his phone and headed out.

The walk to RR took twenty minutes. The sun had dropped low and the sunset was some mix of oranges and red. A few cars and trucks rolled past. Ty thought he should come up with some topics to chat about over the meal. They had already discussed a lot. Did they have much else to say? He could ask Ben about his work or his family.

He rounded the corner and spotted Ben standing on the sidewalk in front, his phone pressed to his ear. He paced a few steps and looked up and saw Ty approaching. He gave a quick wave and held up a finger. "Almost done." He whispered. Ben focused back on the phone, shook his head, and was wrapping up the conversation. He pulled the phone away, hit the red button, and shoved it into his pocket.

"Sorry." Ben exhaled, rubbing his face. "Work nonsense."

"Things okay?"

"Yeah." Ben didn't sound good. He glanced at the restaurant, then back at Ty. "Let's go in."

"If you need to handle something, I can just hang out."

Ben's tone softened. "No, we're fine. I just needed to straighten something out. They treat everything like a fucking dumpster fire."

Ty nodded, not completely convinced. For a second he pictured Ben saying he had to reschedule, the whole night folding up before it started. Ben walked up to the double door and held it open. Ty walked into a small entryway, pulled open the second door, and Ben followed behind.

The sound hit first. Music too loud, a crowd talking over it, dishes clattering. This was not Ana's quiet narrow diner. The “Raunchero” sprawled out in front of them, bright and crowded, piñatas hanging from the ceiling, sombreros on the walls, even mirror balls, and big murals with sunsets and burros by the pueblos. In Ty’s head, the whole place shouted, *Hey gringo! Es Fiesta Time!*

They got a table as far from the commotion as possible.

"Are you hungry?"  Ben scanned the big trifold menu.

“Yeah, kinda starving. I definitely burned through some calories today." Ty said.

“Yeah." Ben glanced up. He still seemed distracted. He closed his menu. "Well, let’s order.”

The waitress with a colorless expression walked up, her pen poised to take the order. She looked at Ben. "What'll you have?"

"Carne asada."

"Medium?"

"Medium rare."

"Corn or flour?" 

Ben looked at her "For?"

"Tortillas."

"Ah, okay. Corn."

"Next."

Ty opted for the Bistec Ranchero. He was tempted to say "Bistec Raunchero," but that marvelous bit of wit would have been wasted on the senora. He kept it to himself and handed over his menu.

Before she could turn away, Ben waved. "Two margaritas, please."

After she left, Ty tilted a bit in her direction and made a "I Love Lucy" face. Ben grinned. "Yep."

She was back in two minutes with the drinks. And they were jumbo size.

"Okay, I forgive her." Ty running his finger along the salt edge. "They must have these things on tap."

Ben leaned in, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. “When do you turn twenty-one?”

Ty hunched over, his furtive eyes scanning the dining room. “Shhh! Not ‘til October. But keep it down! The feds are watching. You know, they've been after me ever since that diamond heist in Miami!”

Ben could play along. He nodded. "I see. Yes, I heard about that. Someone smuggled a billion-dollar necklace out of a celebrity's hotel room in a potted cactus."

"Exactly!"

"And the trail leads right back here."

"Yes!" Ty smacked his hand on the table, and even in the hubbub around them, it was a bit too energetic. An older cowboy couple at a nearby table looked over, then looked back and frowned.

That seemed to shake Ben out of his daze. He relaxed a bit and looked across at Ty. “Proud of yourself, huh?” 

“Maybe.” Ty took a long sip of his drink and changed gears. “So, I looked at your webpage. Nice stuff although I don't know anything about the graphic design pages. I like the charcoal drawings. They’re more memorable.”

"Of course, those were from an elective. I haven't updated that site in ages." Ben swirled his drink. "Feels like a lifetime ago. Everything I do now is commercial so I fight to keep it from being too generic."

"Right. That happens, I'd guess. I mean, you're twenty-nine, you said, right? So on your next birthday, you'll be…  *old*.”

Ben's eyes narrowed. “Sure. Fine. And on your next birthday, you'll finally be shaving.”

"Not if I can help it." Ty smiled into his glass. 

He knew Ben was watching him; he could feel it without even looking. The gaze was steady, patient. He didn't look up, afraid of returning the gaze. Instead, he raised his glass.

“Let’s toast." Ty said. "To us all becoming grownups.” Ben raised his glass and they clinked.

Ty downed half the margarita in one go. "Yum."

“Careful, Godzilla," Ben cautioned. "So, will I be invited to this birthday party?"

“There won’t be a party. Nobody's gonna know. Well, maybe Kenny. He keeps track of such things.”

"Kenny?"

“My one friend from high school. The only person I still know back there. Well, sometimes I hear from my mom, when she’s doing better.”

Ben nodded slowly. "What about Isabella? She would throw you a party?"

“That's true. Especially if she and Rose adopt me.”

“What?” Ben missed the joke. “Okay, right. So, it’s October, what day? I’ll remember.”

“You mean your phone will remember.”

“Do not separate the man from the machine.”

Ty laughed; the tequila had warmed him. "I like that both of us say shit that makes no sense." He risked a look at Ben. He was looking back at him, calm, sitting back and relaxed. Enjoying this too. Ty tried to remember the last time he’d sat across from someone and not wanted to leave. It had been a while.

Two more margaritas and then the food arrived—big plates of steak, topped with onions and sauce, with rice and beans and some guac.

They ate quietly aside from occasional culinary quips. Five minutes later, Ty pushed his clean plate away. 

"Oh god, it's coma time. I need to loosen my belt." He drained the rest of his drink and gazed a bit dreamy at the glass. "And I haven't had a margarita in a long time."

"Like what? Since the Korean War?" Ben finished his last bit of tomato.

"That was my grandfather." Ty smirked.

"Right." Ben shifted. "So tell me more about growing up in Syracuse."

Ty shrugged, eyeing the empty glass. The alcohol made the memories easier to handle. "I left, like I said, I ran off, in November of my junior year. The place sucked. Winter sucked. Everything sucked. My mom was always in bed, sick. My dad... he hated his job, his life, his son. He drank and threw tantrums every night, slamming doors, yelling about the Communists. Or the socialists. Or the immigrants. Or the fags." Ty picked at a napkin. "Having one for a son... well, that just made it special. He kept calling me 'trans.' He had no idea what it meant. He watched Fox News until his brain rotted."

"Your mom was sick?"

"Yep. Depression. Not the mild, manageable kind. She was in and out of the facility and then she started to stay with my aunt. That was better for her but not for me. And my sister went MIA. She's in her thirties and married to a creep. But we were never really close. A big age gap." Ty sighed. "I just want to live on a vineyard in Spain."

Ben was quiet. He kept his eyes on Ty, hands loose around his glass. He didn't offer platitudes. He just listened.

*Okay,* Ty thought. The tequila was buzzing in his veins. He had promised himself to not say anything but the little voice now urged him. *Do it now.*

"Ben, I have a question."

"Yes?"

"Actually, I just want to... clear something up."

"Okay." Ben set his glass down.

"We're just buddies here. Hanging out, right? A couple of dudes having dinner?"

"Sure, I guess. What do you mean?"

"I mean, you know I'm not straight, right?"

"That’s funny. You said that in the negative. But yes, I got that.”

"Sure, sure. But you are? Straight, I mean."

"Yes."

"Just straight?"

"Ty, come on." Ben shifted, looking uncomfortable.

"Sorry. Okay, never mind. Look, I just don't want to misread things. You know. I don’t socialize. Hanging out like this is great, so I don't want things to be weird." Ty paused. "By the way, you don't have to buy me dinner."

"Okay." Ben looked at the table, then back at Ty. "But I *can* pay. I see how hard you work, and I invited you. Don't worry about that please.”

Ty studied him. "Sure. Okay. I just wanted to make sure you understand why I'm asking."

"Yes." Ben hesitated, the pause a bit too long. "I don't know."

"And?"

"And what?"

Ty's felt some annoyance. *Were the margaritas making English difficult?* "Okay, to which part of what I said are you saying 'I don't know'?"

Ben looked cornered. He smoothed his hair back, a nervous tic. "Ty, sorry. Yes, I understand your question. I understand the confusion. I'm not trying to be cryptic. So yes. We're just hanging out."

"Okay. Done. Topic done." Ty forced a smile. "Except, can I ask one more thing? You seem pretty comfortable being around... you know, us 'boys'. Hanging out with a Molly."

"A Molly?" Ben blinked, amused. "Where the hell did that come from?"

Ty pretended to be defensive. "It's a real word. Historical. Maybe a few hundred years old. Back in London. Look it up."

Ben shook his head; a genuine laugh broke the tension. "Yeah, I've heard it. That's hysterical." He leaned back. "To answer your question: yes. I am quite accustomed to hanging around different fringe folk. I mean, in college, I was a Fine Arts major. Half that department was gay. In the summer, I worked as a bartender at a trendy restaurant—all the staff: queer. And then my mom's business: decorators and art dealers. Do the math. For a while, I used to think, *Oh, I'm weird. I'd much rather hang around with these people. They're happy and fun.* If I went to hang out with regular guys, it was all boasting, trash talk about sports, and wanting to get laid."

Ty nodded. "Got it. So you got adopted by the nellies. The token hetero."

Ben shrugged. "I guess. My best friends, my real friends, even now, are of that persuasion. Wait ‘til you meet Charles."

Ty gave a soft smile. "Okay." He wasn't sure how he felt, but at least this seemed to make some sense.

### Chapter 13

For this weekend of July, the nursery wasn’t too busy. It was just too hot. Ty stayed over under the awning of the potting bench, sweating through his shirt while he repotted a row of barrel cacti.

His phone had been quiet. Nearly a week since dinner at the RR. 

Oh well. He'd scared Ben off.

That was fine. Better, actually. Better to reach the inevitable conclusion. Be plain spoken. One of his mom's favorite sayings, ya gotta *be plain spoken*.

He'd already allowed his imagination to run wild. If something seemed to be starting between them, Ty was so far out of Ben's league, he wasn't qualified to be the doorman. 

Ty set down his trowel and wiped his forehead with the back of his glove.

He needed to just back off, stay busy with the flora and avoid the fauna.

On this Wednesday morning, he and Miguel went on a couple of deliveries: two dozen cypress, some cacti in ceramic pots. And when they got back, there was a couple of pallets to break down.

By 1:00 PM, Ty’s shirt was plastered to his back. He wiped grit from his forehead and checked his phone.

A missed call. *Ben.* And a text: *Give me a call.*

Ty walked to the cooler, grabbing a water bottle.

Isabella was on a call and Maya leaned against the counter, wiping her hands on her jeans. "Isabella says there's another delivery coming."

"Wonderful." Ty twisted the cap off the water. "Can't wait."

He hit callback and held the phone to his ear.

Ben picked up on the first ring. “Hi. How are you doing?”

“Wilting,” Ty said, leaning into the shade of the awning. “Like a burning bush. But without Moses, or the Ten Commandments. Why the hell would anyone live here?”

“It's fine here in the office."

"You're a jerk."

"Me? Yeah, maybe." Ben’s voice was light, teasing.

"No. Definitely."

Ben laughed. "Hey, quick question. I have a friend who's having a gallery opening this Friday.”

“Gallery?”

“Art gallery, noob. Would you like to go?”

Ty hesitated. He looked down at his boots, caked in mud and fertilizer. “I don’t know… I think I'd feel weird. A lot of fancy people, right? And I have nothing to wear. My wardrobe screams 'urchin displaced sharecropper'.”

A laugh on the other end. “Come on. Just wear jeans and a T-shirt. Like last time. It's fine."

“Clean ones?”

"Preferably."

"Are you sure?"

Ty looked up. Maya was watching him from across the counter, eyebrows raised, chewing on a straw. Ty raised his hand and formed a cat's claw.

"Yes," Ben said. "Come on. You'll have fun."

"Okay. Deal. It's a date."

As soon as he said it, he heard it. Ty flushed and froze. 

"No. No, I mean... not a *date* date. A plan. Yes. It's a plan."

Ben was laughing now, a warm sound. "Yeah, yeah. Whatever. See you then."

The line went dead.

Ty lowered the phone. Maya was staring at him, a smirk spreading across her face.

"What?" Ty snapped.

"A date, huh?" She arched her wrist in a mock gesture and pitched her voice up high and breathless. *"Tee hee, oops! Not a date. Sorry!"*

Ty narrowed his eyes. "Hey, how about later we go for a little drive in the desert? I have some rope and chloroform."

"Mom! Ty's trying to murder me again!" Maya called out to Isabella above the radio. "This is workplace intimidation. I'm calling HR."

### Chapter 14

Friday night. Ty stood by the main gate as the gray Tacoma pulled up.

Ben’s hand lifted to wave, then faltered mid-air. The truck rolled to a stop. 

Ty took a breath and crossed his arms. He had decided to go for it. *Why not?* It was an art gallery. Might as well try and look the part, whatever that meant. He’d gone to a couple of thrift stores one night after work. Maya had given him a ride. He’d found a nice baggy pair of pleated linen pants, fitted at the waist, and an open tan silk top, unbuttoned, with a low cut black tank top underneath. He’d borrowed eyeliner from Maya. He pulled his hair back into a loose bun, letting a few deliberate strands escape around his face. A bit andro-femme for sure, but so what.

He opened the passenger door and climbed in, pulse up a notch. "Howdy, cowboy! Thanks for the lift!"

Ben didn't say anything. He just stared.

Ty’s smile wavered. "What?"

"You said you didn't have anything to wear." Ben’s eyes traveled from the sheer collar to the loose linen trousers. "You look like you could strut along Rodeo Drive."

Ty let out a nervous laugh. "I don't know about rodeos, but this is what you get when you go twink-thrifting in Tucson."

Ben kept looking, his eyebrows raised. "Well… Wow."

"Is that a good wow, or... something else?"

"I just wasn't expecting you looking like..." Ben seemed to trip over the words. "...this."

"Okay, okay, sorry, let me go change. Give me two minutes." Ty said, his hand reaching for the door handle. "I can throw on jeans and a pancho. Two seconds."

Ben laughed. started the engine. "No, no, it's fine. This should be interesting. Let's just go."

---

Downtown Tucson was busy for the start of the summer weekend. It took a bit of cruising around before Ben found a place to park. People were out, walking past the boutique shops and restaurants, sunset light in the windows.

The gallery was up ahead—a large, brick building—a converted loft with floor-to-ceiling glass along the front and sides. Light spilled out onto the sidewalk, silhouetting some people standing by the entrance.

Inside, light jazz floated over the low murmur of conversation. The space was cavernous, "gallery white" walls stark against the polished concrete floor. In the main room, the art was large-scale—abstract landscapes where horizons dissolved into stencils and patched shapes.

Ty scanned the room. The crowd was two worlds: older couples in gowns and wraps and tailored suits, holding wine glasses by the stems, contrasted with clusters of animated youngsters, a mix of hipsters and la-la artists with asymmetrical haircuts.

Ty felt a little less like an alien.

Ben saw a middle-aged couple, waved, and walked to them. Ty trailed behind, not sure if he should come along.

"Hey, how are you guys?" Ben shook their hands. Jesse, a man in his forties with a friendly, grounded vibe, smiled back. "Excellent." His wife, Meiko, offered a warm smile, though her eyes lingered on Ty for an extra moment.

Before introductions could be made, a man in a studded vest and shimmering gray slacks—cut loose and high-waisted—swooped in. He leaned in and touched cheeks with Ben.

"Look who's arrived! Bentley! How have you been?"

Ben laughed, looking genuinely happy to see him. "Hi, Charles. Wonderful. This is Jesse and Meiko. Jesse's a co-worker. Congratulations on the opening. This is a nice turnout."

"Yes, we're pleased. Blake's already sold one of the landscapes." He shook hands with Jesse and Meiko. Then he spied Ty standing behind Ben. "And who is this?"

Ben moved to the side. "Oh, yes, this is Ty. I brought him. He works at a nursery. Remember, I told you, I am having some planters made for my balcony. He's working on them."

Charles raised a perfectly plucked eyebrow. "Really? So, Ty, you are a *gardener*? Well!" He extended a hand and they shook. "It's nice to meet you." He held Ty's had a few extra beats. "And how long have you and Ben been *friends*?”

“Stop it, Charles. He’s a good kid.”

“Okay…” He locked his gaze back on Ben. “Sure, he’s also gorgeous."

Heat rushed to Ty's face. He looked at the floor.

"Charles, Jesus!" Ben warned. "Don't embarrass the poor guy." He turned to Ty, concerned. “Sorry, I should have warned you.”

Ty recovered, forcing himself to look up and smile. "It's fine." He gestured to the main wall. "So these are your paintings?"

"Yes. What do you think? Do you like them?"

"Very much," Ty said quietly.

"Ty actually knows something about art," Ben said. "He's a fan of Ecole de Paris."

Charles immediately animated again. "Aren't we all? Well, we must chat later. Excuse me all, I’m on schmooze duty. Ta-ta!"

Charles swirled away. Ty stayed by Ben for a few minutes, but as Ben and Jesse’s conversation turned to office politics, Ty wandered off. He moved towards another room where a cluster of smaller paintings hung on display.

---

Ben finished catching up with Jesse then Jesse and his wife left for dinner. Ben stood alone for a moment, surrounded by small circles of conversations and restrained laughter. He scanned the room for Ty and found him in one of the side rooms, moving slowly along a wall of smaller paintings.

Ben finished catching up with Jesse about office news. Jesse and his wife then left for dinner. Ben stood alone for a moment, surrounded by conversations and restrained laughter. He scanned the room for Ty and found him in a side room, moving slowly along a wall of smaller paintings.

Charles materialized next to him.

"So, Bentley, you're on a date?"

Ben turned to him, keeping his expression calm. He had expected this. "Charles, please, don't start. He's just a nice kid. I brought him because I knew he’d like it. And he doesn’t know anyone around here. He's just here working."

Charles arched an eyebrow. “Yes, Ben, sure, okay. Let’s go with that. But let’s just say, if maybe a handsome single guy, like you for example, was to be a bit adventurous, or shall we say, *ambidextrous*—they might find him more than just ‘nice’.”

Ben looked at him, then laughed and shook his head. "Ambidextrous? Charles, have you got the right word?"

"Yes, and don't quibble, dear. The point of language is conveyance—of a thought or idea or message—and I am confident that you got all three."

Charles winked, grabbed a fresh glass, and pirouetted off toward another  group of guests.

Ben looked up, and Ty was walking back his way. Ben handed him a glass as Ty reached him. “Here, hopefully, they don’t card. So, what do you think?”

“Thanks.” Ty took a sip and peered at Ben over the rim of his glass. “This is a blast. Charles’s work is cool. And what an interesting group of people. I feel like I’m in Never-Never Land.”

### Chapter 15

By 9:30, the gallery had thinned out. Ty was back in the corner again, looking at small abstracts when Ben showed up.

"You had enough? Ready to go?"

"Yes. Time for Cinderella to change back into a pumpkin."

Ben hestitated then nodded. “Oh, I see. I get it, but you mangled the story—the *coach* turns into a pumpkin, not Cinderella.”

"Well, consider it poetic license, and Cinderella wasn't a ladyboy."

"What?" Ben blinked, unamused. "Why would you say that? And how do you know what a ladyboy is?"

"How do *you* know?" Ty raised an eyebrow. "More secrets to tell?"

"You make no sense." Ben shook his head, a bit impatient. "Come on. I want to say goodbye to Charles."

Outside, the temperature had cooled. They walked toward the truck.

"Hungry?" Ben asked. "There are food trucks over at the park."

"Sure. But it's my turn to buy."

"No. No way. Don't start with that." Ben now a bit irked.

"Excuse me, Mr. MBA."

"That's not what I am." Ben softened.  "And keep your slippers on, Cinderella."

The park was alive, a line of six food trucks glowing against the dark trees. They grabbed two massive burritos from a Tex-Mex step van and sat aways down on a concrete wall.

"Yum. Tasty."

Ty chewed, staring at his foil wrapper. He felt Ben watching him.

"What?" Ben asked.

Ty swallowed. "I know we've talked about this. Maybe it's been put to bed.” He gave a slight cough. “Oops, not the best turn choice of words. But anyway, let me paint a picture. You see, there's this room. And I'm in it. And you're there. Or maybe you're not..." Ty gestured vaguely at the darkness.

"What are you talking about, Ty?"

"Stay with me. You're good at playing along." Ty was intent. "There's an elephant in the room, An Indian elephant. It's big and it's sucking up all the oxygen. And it hasn't taken a dump in like a year. And I'm confused—should I stay or find a way out. I mean, I feel like this is uncomfortable, or worse. But how to escape? But time's running out because there's this smelly, old fat guy, down on his knees, no shirt, and he's a painter. He's painting the floor and he'll yell at us if we step on the paint, so he's painting us into a corner. Maybe there's an escape hatch over there but I can't really see. It's foggy or dark, I don't know. Anyway, I just realized I'm wearing a jet pack and I have the button in my hand.  I just have to press it and kabang! I'll be gone. Then everything will be fine. The elephant will disappear. The painter will vanish. In fact, all the walls of the room will just fall away. Everything would be fine, back to normal.

Ben stared at him. "Nothing you just said made any sense. Are you smoking something? Peyote? Did you down a fifth of Mescal in the bathroom?"

"Charles asked if we're dating."

Ben sighed, took a moment and then rubbed his face. "Of course he did. That's Charles. He can make a soap opera out of a bag of carrots."

"Yes, drama carrots. Jealousy, regrets, spoils and rot."

"Ty, seriously..." Ben sounded old now, and tired.

"Okay, sorry. But you're ducking. And I'm asking because..." Ty turned to him. "Because I can't read you."

"Ty, I feel like we've covered this. Ignore Charles. Now and always. I love him but he lives for drama."

"Sure. I understand. Promise. Last time." Ty picked at the foil. "It's just... this feels like a date."

The question dropped with too much weight. It was suddenly quiet around them.

"I get that," Ben whispered.

"Okay, but you didn't answer the question."

"Yeah. Sorry."

Ty waited. The silence stretched and began to suffocate him. Probably he should have stopped after three glasses of wine. "Okay. Never mind. Clearly this is a 'Me' problem. I'm just... misconstruing. That's the word." Ty stared down the street. "This guy, Ben, a man of few words and mixed signals. Fine. Forget it."

He stood up and started walking.

"Okay, one more try." Ty spun, took a few steps back. "Let's flip this. What would you guess is *my* attitude toward *you*?"

"No idea."

Ty stiffened, pissed, his words flew out. "Really? Come on. That's bullshit!" His fist clenched a moment. "That's total, utter, crapping cow shit. 'No idea.' Fuck that."

Ben raised his hands to calm things. "Ty—"

"I'm done, Ben. I’m done here. I'm making a mistake. I have a full day tomorrow shoveling actual manure. I'll see you later." Ty turned and headed off towards the street.

Ben stood up from the wall. "Ty, wait. Come on."

"No, thanks."

"Dude, it's like ten miles."

"It's fine. Cinderella will find her own way home."

"What the... Okay, Ty! Stop!" Ben jogged to catch up. "I'm sorry. I'm not trying to play games. The answer is 'I don't have an answer', okay? And I understand that's messed up. But at least let me give you a ride home."

### Chapter 16

They were on the edge of the city now and Ben turned left onto the road that headed out to the nursery. Traffic was light. Ty stared out the window, watching the streetlights blur into streaks of orange. If he just closed his eyes to thin slits, the light would refract and sparkle. This all felt strange even as a giant fuck-up. He’d blown it, but that was inevitable. So no biggie, right?

Ben pulled up by the front gate and killed the engine. Silence took over.

"Ty, wait. Can I say something?" Ben tensed, stopped, then started again. "This is weird. I know. I don't have an answer. I mean... I guess the answer is: Yes. It was a date."

Ben looked out past the headlights, at the moths dancing in the beams. "But then, I ask myself, what does that mean? I don't want to tell you because… do I know what’s going on? No. How can I figure anything out? Why would you be interested? Maybe that’s a dumb question. I don’t know. So if I do like you that way, then what? But we keep it platonic? It doesn’t feel that way. Honestly, I’m afraid of you, or nervous, I guess. So what *is* that? Is any of it fair to you? Would you be—"

Ty's hand shot up like a traffic cop. "Enough." He exhaled and turned to face Ben. He felt his eyes shining and he looked at Ben's profile in the dim outline. Ty's voice was muted. "I got my answer. So just stop. Relax. Enough said. I got it, and the rest of that was just… Ben Brain Seepage." He leaned over and pressed a soft kiss to Ben's cheek. "Goodnight."

He reached for the door handle and the latch clicked.

But Ben had stayed rigid, like he’d been unplugged.

Ty paused as he was getting out. He turned and looked back. "Are you okay?"

Ben turned, and his arm reached out to hold Ty's shoulder. Ben leaned over to him. Now this close, Ben paused for a moment and kissed him. Not a quick touch and go, not a cheek peck. A kiss that was unmistakable. Ty responded and then had to catch his breath. Ben's embrace was tender yet urgent. Ty felt his chest pound. He took another shaky moment and drew back, but then Ben moved in and kissed him again.

It felt like a spinning forever and then Ty had to pull back. He looked at Ben’s face in the darkness. Ty raised his hand to Ben's cheek and whispered. “I told you," He exhaled, revealing too much. "I had the answer. No need to run up the meter."

He pressed a final kiss and jumped from the truck. Jogging to the gate, he disappeared inside.

### Chapter 17

Ty woke up feeling like he hadn't slept at all. His brain was foggy, and his limbs felt heavy. It was a Saturday, and it always seemed like people would show up in waves. They'd have one or two stragglers, and then five cars would suddenly arrive. Maya was convinced there was a conspiracy. He wasn't going to argue. On top of everything, she was asking him about his not-a-date date.

At lunchtime, his phone buzzed.

*I want to talk. Can I come by tonight?*

Ty punched the screen. *Yes.*

By 4 p.m., it was quiet, and his lack of sleep must have been obvious. Isabella told him to call it a day. He showered and managed to get a two hour nap.

Ben showed up around 8pm and texted,  *I'm out front.*

Ty threw on a fresh shirt and walked out. Ben was leaning against his truck, arms crossed.

"Hey." Ben spoke first.

"Hi." Ty pointed to a wooden bench near the fence line. “We can sit over there until the bugs find us.”

Ben handed him a bottle of iced tea. “Thanks.”

They sat. The plastic bottle sweated in Ty’s hand.

"So," Ty said, staring at the gravel. "You kissed a guy last night."

“Yes."

"First time?"

"Ty. Stop it."

“Sorry. I'm stupid when I’m nervous.”

“You're nervous?”

“Yeah, Ben, I'm fucking nervous! I have no idea what's going on. What direction is the wind blowing today? I swore I wouldn't let this happen. I'm really not into some bang fest with a straight guy who's just decided "Take a Walk on the Wild Side" sounds like a bit of freaky recreation. So I hope you're here to tell me you're really sorry, that the kiss last night was an enormous mistake." He squares up and changes his tone. *Gee, Ty. I don't know what happened. I just got carried away.* Yada, yada, bullshit. Lots of fucking fun, right? Until it starts to drive me nuts, and we passed that point a few hundred miles back."

Ty shifted. Ben stayed still, not moving, not reacting. Ty kept pushing on the sweat on iced tea. "If, by any chance, we stay friends then I want permission—officially, formally—to punch the shit out of you when you say ‘Gee, Ty, are you nervous?’”

Ty felt like his hands were shaking. He turned his face away, ashamed that he might lose it. *Fuck, fuck, fuck.*

“Ty, stop.”

Ty faced forward, wiping his cheek on his sleeve. “I'm good, Ben. Look, forget it.” He took a big breath. "Are we good here? Can I go back inside?"

Ben sat still. “No.”

"No?" Ty whipped around again. "What? We're not good? Really, then what?"

Ben looked down at his hands. "Then… I don't know."

Ty's jaw tightened. "So you gave me permission to punch you? Hard?"

"Sure." Ben slumped.

They sat in the gathering dark as a couple of cars went past. Ben spoke. "Ty. It wasn't a mistake. But…"

“Finish your fucking sentence! God, sometimes I think your brain is a gyroscope in a black hole." Ty pushed back on the bench and exhaled. "Ben, it's simple. What do you want? You’re thirty, you’re straight, you’re smart, and well off, and good looking as hell. Go find yourself a hottie chick or perfect housewife… or whatever. But around me? We dated. That was a date. I'd really prefer if we just stop. Dump me, or don't dump me. But enough. Stay friends? Unlikely, but fine. Charades with Charles. But do you know what's not fine? Not telling me what's going on. And then last night." He turned toward the building. "I'm going in. I'm exhausted. I didn't sleep."

"Neither did I."

Ty swung around, his face hot. "Oh, that's great. You say shit like that, and what the fuck am I supposed to think? God, you kill me." He rubbed his temples. "Okay. We both need sleep. And this is accomplishing nothing but feeding mosquitoes."

"Ty, I get it. You're right. About everything. But I can say it: I like you. You're the one person I want to be around right now. And the last person I ever want to hurt."

"Ben, that's a lot different than wanting to... you know. So I think you need some time, or a lot of time. You think about it. Or don't."

"Ty..." Ben reached for his hand.

Ty jerked away. "Ben. I'm deciding. A break. Okay? Good night. And next time, bring a can of bug spray."

Ty walked to the gate. As he reached his door, he heard Ben's truck start up and slowly pull away.

### Chapter 18

Almost a week had passed. Fourth of July was two days away, a Friday. Ty had managed to keep busy, or just distracted. Now, at lunchtime, the three of them sat around the front counter when the Tacoma pulled up.

"What the hell," Ty stared out at the truck. 

"Uh oh," Maya said, abandoning the spoon in her yogurt.

"Shut up. Let me see what he wants."

Ty jogged out to the truck before Ben could open the door. "The planters aren't ready yet."

Ben was just getting out. "I know."

"So what's up?"

"Nothing. I mean, not really. How are you?" Ben opened the door and stepped out. He seemed taller than Ty remembered.

"I'm fine." Ty gave a short nod. “But surprised.”

"Can we talk?"

"Yes, of course. But how about later, or will this be short? Why didn't you just text me."

"I wanted to come out and see you."

"Okay, here I am, wearing my finest."

"I've decided something. I want to see you. Like, I think we should start dating. At least, that's what I want to ask you. If you..."

Ty let out a sharp, incredulous laugh. "Oh, okay. Can you ever just say something in a simple way? So now Ben, that's you, wants to see Ty, that's me. Okay. What has Ben decided? If you just want to see me, let me get you a link to my OnlyFans. But that's only lingerie, no spandex; I get a rash."

"Jesus, Ty, please." Ben was hushed.

"Okay, Ben. Sorry. What's going on?"

"I want to try. Going out. Dating with you. You and me."

Ty stared at him. The sun beat down on the back of his neck. "Really? Something changed? Because last time it was Adios, muchacho.”

“I didn’t say that.”

“Oh, great. Now we need a transcript. Whatever. What about me? Should I change my mind?"

"You can give me a chance."

"True." Ty crossed his arms, rocking back on his heels. "I *should* tell you that I’ll let you know, that I’ll take a week and think about it. You know, be a bit coy and play hard to get. But I’m tired, so sure, yes, we can go out sometime. But there will be conditions. A verbal contract and agreement. Like I told you, I see a thousand ways that this ship won't stay afloat and my poor little queer heart ends up as roadkill the outskirts of Fat Chance, Arizona. And I don't need that." He took a breath. "Probation. A trial period. We take it slow. Deal?"

"Okay, Ty. I get it."

"For real?"

"Yes." Ben’s voice was solemn.

"Okay, see, I did make it easy. Let's shake." Ty shook Ben’s hand. He wanted a hug but that sort of broke his oath.

Ben’s looked down. "So. I know this isn't slow, but how about Friday? Fourth of July fireworks downtown."

"Friends can go out and watch the fireworks. The ones in the sky."

Ben looked exasperated, but the smile reached his eyes. "Geez, you're like nobody else. Yes, only in the sky."

"Okay. See you then."

Ben started the truck and put it in gear. Ty stood in the dust for a moment, then headed back to the counter.

Maya was waiting. "Well, well, well. I can guess what *that* was about.”

Ty couldn't suppress the smile fighting its way onto his face. "Shut up. And mind your own beeswax."

Maya turned to Isabella. "We should have filmed the next season of *The Gay Bachelorette* right here at the Bella Adobe."

"Is that a real show?" Ty asked.

"No, honey. But if it were, you'd be in Season 7: *The Migrant Tweaker Farmboy Edition*."

Ty narrowed his eyes and raised a finger. "Too bad the wood chipper's not here. We could reenact that scene from *Fargo*."

Isabella shook her head. "Oh my god. You two."

### Chapter 19

The Fourth of July.

Ty stared at his reflection. He’d debated the linen suit again, or at least, a nice shirt and some nicer jeans he'd picked up when thrifting—but then he remembered the mosquitoes. They loved him. His mom used to say it was because his blood was sweet.

*Screw fashion,* he decided. *I'm going for survival.*

He pulled on thick gray sweatpants, socks, and a long-sleeved shirt. He shoved his hair under a baseball cap and checked the mirror.

"Hell," he muttered. "Almost a dude."

He waited out front, swatting at a bug, when Ben rolled up. Ty jumped in.

"Hey there!"

Ben looked him over. "Hi. You look... comfortable."

"Aw shucks, Mister. I'm wearing my groovy K-Mart tube socks, too. Wanna see?" Ty batted his eyelashes. "What time's the finale?"

"You mean the fireworks?"

"Touché, douchebag. Yes, the fireworks. In the sky. And since when did you become Mr. Innuendo?"

"It was only sarcasm," Ben said, merging onto the main road. "But to answer your question: I have no idea. It was a crazy day at the office."

"Sorry. It sounds like we both deal with lots of bullshit—literal cow shit in my case. I guess I’d prefer that. The kind you can actually shovel.”

"Yeah… Good point." Ben sighed, keeping his eyes on the road. "This client is a nightmare. He's a control freak and has to make sure we all know he's the 'man in charge'. He changes the whole approach almost every week. We call him 'Mr. Etch A Sketch.' He gets a good shake and everything's erased."

"I'm glad I just deal with plants," Ty said. "Even the spikey ones sound better than that."

"Yeah, so I might have to go back to Denver," Ben grimaced. "We need to turn this around. I need to be there in person."

Ty turned in his seat. "That's funny. You moved here to be face-to-face with the client, but now you have to go back there to what? Huddle with your boss?"

"Exactly. Contradictions abound. Honestly, I'd rather be at a drafting table."

"You still use a drafting table?"

"No. Just being nostalgic. It's all CAD now. I'll be replaced by an AI next year. Then you can show me how to bag fertilizer."

"Fertilizer is a polite way to say manure. Manure is a polite way to say cow shit. I prefer 'cow pies'. But yeah, my job's safe. Robots refuse to touch the stuff." Ty paused. "But then only the robots and their masters will have money."

"Right. So why would they need gardens?"

"To cover up all our graves."

Ben laughed, a startled sound. "You're pretty dark."

"Nah. This is me on a good day." Ty rolled down the window, letting the hot wind hit his face.

---

Ben found parking a few blocks away. The city park was full of families and couples sitting on blankets across the lawn. And folks strolled along sidewalks;   kids darted between them, running circles and yelling. He and Ben decided on a spot that seemed more quiet, on the far edge of the meadow, near a long row of hedges. 

Ben said he'd take care of the food and drink. He had an old wool blanket and a cooler bag. They spread the blanket and Ben knelt down and began to unload the cooler. He pulled out sandwiches, snacks, veggies, and actual plates, napkins, cutlery. Even a citronella candle. 

Ty stood and watched. "Wow. Impressive. You'll make some little woman very happy with your domestic skills."

"Stuff it, buddy."

They both sat now, settled a bit, and looked over the crowded meadow. The sky had just gone dark when the first rockets whistled up, exploding in showers of gold and green. With each detonation, much of the meadow let out low murmurs of appreciation.

"Whoa..." Ty whispered as the finale shook the ground. "I haven't seen fireworks since forever."

In the dim light, someone strolled up. "Bentley! Darling! Hello!"

Ty looked over. It was Charles, flanked by a friend. And tonight, like every night, Charles was not to be missed. He was decked out in a billowing print caftan.

Ben laughed. He and Ty stood up.

"Well, well, well," Charles beamed. "Fancy meeting you here. Bentley's out in public again!"

"Yes, Charles." Ben smirked.

"And look at this!" Charles waved his arm over the blanket, the candle, the plates. "A nice little picnic. All by yourselves? So this is the designated boy-boy section?" He didn't wait for an answer. He turned his beam on Ty. "Ty, darling, how are you?"

"I'm good. How are you?"

"Fantastic! Splendid! Fabuloso!" Charles gestured to the man beside him. "Have you met Dean? Ben, you know Dean."

"Yes. Hi, Dean. How are you doing?" Ben nodded to the stocky man in leather shorts.

"Real good, Ben," Dean said. "I'm on Charles duty tonight. Keeping him out of trouble."

"Tough assignment," Ben said. "Good luck."

"So, Charles," Ty spoke up. "How did Ben get his nickname?"

Charles did a little flutter with his hands. "Bentley? Well, you know... if he were a car, he wouldn't be a Chevy, right? Unattainable, expensive to operate, not a practical way to get around, but very classy." He raised an eyebrow.

"Jesus. Enough, Charles," Ben muttered.

Ty laughed. 

"Oh, this is fun!" Charles gave Ty a wink. "He must like you. He's never been this easy to terrorize."

"I don't know..." Ty played along. "We're just good friends, right, Mr. Nakamura?"

Ben looked from one to the other. "You two can go climb a tree."

Charles's perpetual motion paused, and he gave Ben a look of pity. "That's your comeback? 'Climb a tree'? Darling, don't bring a butter knife to a drag race." He turned to Ty. "I need your number. We need to strategize."

"Oh yes." Ty smiled. He pulled out his phone and handed it to Charles.

Ty looked over and spotted a middle-aged man waving from the path. He  nudged Ben. "Do you know those people?"

Ben looked over. "Shit, yep, it's someone from the office. I'll be right back." Ben headed over to them. The guy was dressed in khaki pants and a polo, standing with a woman who looked like his wife. When Ben reached them, they shook hands. Ty could see Ben was being professional and gracious. 

The husband would  glance over Ben’s shoulder to where he and Charles and Dean were standing. He was not doing a good job of concealing his interest. There probably weren't a lot of flamboyance to be found in his suburban neighborhood. The wife was looking over too. Ty caught her gaze and gave a little smile. 

"What they must think," he muttered to Charles.

"Yes, well, Ben's gotta keep up appearances, you know." Charles swirled his hand in the air. "Hell, we all do. Except maybe you; the flowers and shrubs couldn't care less."

Ben finished and was walking back. He looked relaxed.

Ty watched him and smiled, "Somebody from your office?"

"Yep."

"Surprised to see you here?"

"Probably."

"They seemed curious about us."

"No doubt."

"So why didn't you bring them over and introduce us?"

"Knock it off."

Ty watched the couple walk away. Ben seemed unconcerned. He stood there, relaxed, hands in his pockets, flanked by the circus. He hadn't invited the coworker in, but he hadn't run away, either.

The Charles Show continued—gossip, cat fights, sordid tales, theatrics.

As they stood there in the warm night, Ty felt an impulse with Ben just next to him. *Fuck it.* He slid his arm through Ben’s.

Ben stiffened for a moment, surprised. Charles saw it and paused mid-sentence, his eyes darting down to their linked arms.

Ben looked down at Ty's arm and then back up at him with a soft smile. He didn't pull away. Instead, he brought his other hand over to Ty's arm and let it stay—a warm, steady touch. 

Charles, with perfect timing, picked up his story without missing a beat.

Ty stared straight ahead at the night sky. Some stars were visible. His heart still thumped and he thought maybe Ben could feel it.  For a moment, Charles's voice seemed to fade away and he just let his fingers brush along Ben's arm. He shook himself. Charles was looking at him. 

"You okay?" Charles asked.

"Yeah, yeah, sorry. Just lost in a fog," Ty replied.

"Obviously. Well, kids, let's call it a night. Dean, you ready?"

"Quite so, your highness."

### Chapter 20

Charles and Dean strolled off as Ty and Ben packed up. They walked back to the truck and tossed the stuff in the back. By 9:30, the celebration seemed over.

As they stowed the stuff in the back, Ben asked him, "You hungry?"

"Maybe." 

Ben motioned and began to walk. "Let's go. Ever had sushi?"

"No." Ty caught up.

"Really?"

"Sorry, it was never on the menu at Burger Chef, and at home it was Spaghetti-O's and Hot Pockets." 

"Well then, wanna try?" 

"Raw fish, right? And it's expensive?" 

"Enough about that. I asked you out. Here's your chance."

"Well then, let's experiment." Ty quipped.

The sushi place was a small storefront and still busy. They found a small table and sat. Ty stared at the laminated menu. "I have no idea what any of this is."

"I'll order different stuff, nothing weird. Trust me?"

Ty looked at him, eyebrow raised. "Really? You're gonna just throw that out there?" Ty smirked. "For sushi, sure, but otherwise, no, Ben, I don't trust you."

"Yeah, okay, I should have known. Let me rephrase. Ty, do you trust me to order us dinner off this menu?"

Ty grinned, overplaying a nod. "Sure, daddy."

"Jesus." Ben groaned.

A waiter stopped by and Ben placed an order for the big sushi combo, plus a roll and gyoza dumplings. The waiter returned with a pot of tea and small dishes of pale green paste.

"Wasabi," Ben pointed to it. "Japanese horseradish. Start with a tiny bit."

Ty dabbed a speck on his tongue. The heat shot straight up his nose, detonating behind his eyes. He coughed, eyes watering. 

"Whoa, baby. That clears the sinuses."

"Told you."

"I love it."

"Really?"

"Yeah." Ty watched Ben mix the paste into his soy sauce dish and mimicked him.

The platter arrived—a lineup of shining bright, sliced fish on rice. 

"That's cool." Ty looked over the platter. 

"How are your chopstick skills?"

"Not great." Ty picked up a piece of salmon. It slipped, performed a backflip, and splashed into the soy sauce, spraying his shirt.

"Oops. Shit, I've blown the evening. Take me home." Ty dabbed at the spot with a napkin. He tried again with the chopsticks and this time, he secured the fish, dipped it, and got it to his mouth. He chewed slowly. His eyes widened.

"Well?" Ben asked.

"God! Yum. What's that one?"

"Hamachi. Yellowtail. That's my favorite. And that one is tuna. Try them."

"So do you speak Japanese?"

"Some. I wouldn't say I'm fluent. I picked it up mostly from when I was studying there. Growing up, it was just English around the house."

They dove in. Ty worked his way through the colors. For each type of fish, there was a pair so they could sample them together. Ty agreed, hamachi was the winner. Soon, the wooden board was empty.

"Excellent." Ben sat back, sipping his tea.

"Well, yes, my first raw dining." Ty wiped his mouth. "I get it now. So tell me more about life before Tucson. Starting in kindergarten. Especially your romantic life. Every crush and blush. High school hotties, sex parties, strippers, escorts, street walkers. All of it. Oh, and bachelor parties. I hear those get out of control."

"Yeah, right." Ben set his cup down. "Nothing wacky. Not much to tell. I didn't date in high school. I was really shy, and I had skipped a grade so I was really immature." 

"What about college?"

"Yeah, by then I was waking up. A couple of girlfriends. It would last for a semester and then it would fizzle. And by third year, I focused on other things. I studied a lot and worked in a restaurant. If I went out, I'd meet up with crazy artist friends and just have fun."

Ben poured more tea.

"My one serious relationship was a woman at work, Rebecca. We met through some friends. She worked at headquarters, so I had never met her there. We dated for almost two years. We got along okay, but she was looking to get married. I get it. My dad was pushing me, too. But I didn't want to take that next step. Then one Friday, at her place, she started talking about all her friends getting engaged. Hint, hint, nudge, nudge. A week later, she said she wanted to break it off. At first I was upset, but it wasn't a week before I realized it was fine. Another matter-of-fact breakup. Like a bathtub full of water, you pull the plug, wait a bit and you look in the tub, yep, that's empty. Probably it's me."

"Yeah, there's a lot of people that don't fit the mold."

"Yep, for sure. Anyway, it’s been fine. I just focus on work and friends. And I have a nice place here. My place in Denver was a six hundred square foot box on the twelfth floor. I hated it." Ben looked up, meeting Ty's eyes. "My mom always told me, 'You’re too much of a people-pleaser'—that I always let everyone have their way. I can see it so I'm trying to get better."

"I'm rooting for you. Your mom sounds cool." Ty looked back.

"She is." Ben leaned back. "After that, I realized I needed to not go along for the sake of going along. I'll be thirty. Like you said, an old man, so it seems like a good time for a change."

He looked across the table. Ty was smirking. 

"What's funny?" 

"Nothing." 

"Come on, what?" 

"Well, yes, a change like leaving Denver. But maybe other changes too." 

"Yeah, I guess." Ben stared back at him. This one had gone over his head. 

Ty waited, then put down his napkin. "You're tired. Let's go." 

The drive back was nice, the windows rolled down and some Shins on the stereo. They reached the nursery. 

"Good night, buddy." Ty smiled over at him. 

"Hey, how about Monday afternoon? We take a drive, do a little hiking up in the foothills. There's a place, Willow Canyon, that I've been to a few times; it's really nice. Just for the afternoon. I checked the weather—it's not supposed to be too hot." 

"Sounds great. It would be great to get out to see some of the area."

### Chapter 21

During the day, Ben had sent Ty a text that said, "I'm at work. Apparently, the client had a hissy fit this morning and called my boss, wanting everything redone. This guy is a lunatic. I will call you tonight."

That night, Ty was sitting at the table with his phone and sketchbook. He had some jazz music on; it was what his mom would always listen to. His phone jarred the quiet.

"Hey," Ben said.

"Greetings," Ty replied.

"Looks like I can't meet up tomorrow, and yeah, well, it looks like I have to go to Denver this week." Ben sounded beat.

“I talked to my boss this afternoon. He said he told the guy he's paying for the rework since he signed off on everything last month. Anyway, all that is between them. But it's not going well so I get to fly to Denver for meetings and planning.”

“Where are you going to stay?” Ty asked.

“A hotel. There's one right by the office. That way, I won't need a car.”

“What about Rebecca? Would she have a spare room?”

“You're funny—and that was a pretty catty even for you.”

“Sorry, you know what they say.”

“No, what do they say?”

“Oh, I was hoping you'd tell me. My brain's too sizzled to come up with anymore catty shots. I think I'm at about eight percent right now.”

“Yeah, me too. This project has reached nightmare level.”

### Chapter 22

That Wednesday, Ben got on a plane for Denver. He hoped it would be just for the week, but with Mr. Etch-a-Sketch, you could never tell. The weekend came and went. Ben called every night, usually a quick chat. Ben was tired, so Ty let him go.

Monday came and went, then Tuesday evening, Ben sent a text. *Still no progress. Just shoot me.*

A half hour later he called.

"How bad is it?" Ty asked.

"Bad enough that I'm questioning my existence."

"Can you transfer out of there? Just change projects?"

"No, that's not a good option." Ben went quiet. "I'll figure it out."

Ty felt his chest tighten at the strain in Ben’s voice. "I'm sorry."

"No, I'm sorry. I shouldn't be laying this on you. I'm just catastro—what's the stupid word? Catastrophizing? Anyway. I know where I'd rather be."

Ben's voice trailed off. Ty felt the pull of it across the miles.

"Yeah," Ty whispered. "Let's not go there."

"I miss you," Ben said quietly.

Ty cleared his throat. "Stop it. Get some rest, okay? I gotta go."

---

That Thursday night, Ty had been to Ana's and was back in his room, about ready to pass out. His phone rang. He smiled and reached for it.

"Good evening, Mr. Nakamura. It's nice to hear your voice."

"I haven't said anything yet."

"Okay, then, it's nice to know you're breathing."

Ben laughed.

Ty sat back in the chair. "So what's the latest with client Armageddon?"

"We're getting close. I think we made real progress today."

"What about Rebecca? Have you been spending time together? Rekindling?"

"Knock it off. I met her for lunch one day. She was nice enough. It was fine."

"And did you tell her you're dating queer boys now?"

"No, and I am not dating 'boys', just you."

"So I'm special?"

Ben's exhale and sigh were audible. "Here goes Ty and his cheeky word games. It's never a game I win."

"Don't think—just answer."

"You'd like that, wouldn't you?"

"I don't know but I'd consider it progress." Ty quietly cleared his throat. "Anyway, on to some business, your planters are still at the workshop and there's no firm date yet. When do you think you'll be back?"

"I think pretty soon."

"Good to hear. Can we go to the sushi place? I got a hankering."

"Hankering? What kind of word is that?"

### Chapter 23

A text arrived from Ben during lunch on Tuesday. *I’m done here! Heading back. Should be in Tucson by noon tomorrow. Office first, then I can head to your place later.*

*Yes.* Ty texted back.

Ty went to Ana's and picked up burritos. He was sitting outside when Ben pulled up. Ty stood up as the engine cut.

A weary Ben stepped out. 

"You're back." Ty reached out.

"I'm back." Ben offered a weary smile.

They hugged.

"This poor guy," Ty held on. "Client crisis averted?"

"For now." Ben rubbed his temples; his voice was hoarse.

"You look like hell."

"Thanks. That's the look I was going for. At least I showered and got a clean shirt." 

"And you don't sound too good."

"Yeah, I think I'm catching something. Airports and planes get me sick."

"'That's because those places are full of disease—and people."

"I guess."

"I picked up burritos and cokes. Let's just go and eat inside." Ty grabbed the takeout and headed to the side gate.

They sat at a small picnic table behind the counter. There was enough light from that one floodlight on the storage building.

Ben unwrapped the burrito. "Looks good, I've missed this."

"Hope you like it. I finally got to buy you dinner. Will you have to go back to Denver soon?"

"No, I shouldn't. My boss said if this client changes his mind again, we're going to cancel the project. We want to avoid that. With this guy, you'll end up in court."

"I think your planters will be ready soon. Like two weeks. As soon as we get them from the woodworker, we'll get them planted."

"Sounds good. At least something to look forward to." Ben let out a sigh. He just about inhaled the burrito. 

Ty sat and watched him. "I should let you go."

They walked back to the truck and Ty spoke up. "Ben, go home and crash. Honestly, I should drive *you* home."

"Yeah. Sorry. Not much of a date, huh?"

"It was perfect. I know you're tired. I'm happy I could see you."

Ty walked him to the driver's side door. He hugged him again, feeling Ben’s weight lean into him for just a second. He wanted to kiss him but stopped himself. He waited until the tail lights disappeared down the highway before heading inside.

### Chapter 24

The next morning, Thursday,  Ty sent a text. *How you feeling?*

The reply came an hour later. *Honestly? Like shit. Can't sleep, and this cough won't quit.*

*Get some rest.*

*Yeah.*

Ty stared at the phone. He wanted to say more, offer to come by that night and bring soup, or something equally mushy. He shoved the phone in his pocket.

The day dragged. Customers, mulch, watering. Miguel showed up with some lunch that his wife had made. Spicy, but tasty. Maya was harassing him about something. It didn't matter what. 

After closing and a quick shower, Ty just wanted to hear Ben's voice. He called. No answer. He called again. Same result. He thought about it. Had he ever called this guy? He couldn't remember when. That's the way he wanted it. He didn't want Ben to know how he felt. But now, he realized, he was losing control. He missed Ben. 

Ten minutes later, he walked to Ana's and slid into his usual booth.

Ana came out from the kitchen. "By yourself again?"

"Yep. Ben's been gone, his work is crazy. He's back now but sick with the flu."

"Ah, none of that sounds good." She nodded. "I have some Sopa left. Do you want it?"

"Perfect." 

She brought it right out. But after a couple of bites, he realized he wasn't hungry. He checked his phone again.

Ana emerged from the kitchen, untied her apron, grabbed two beers and sat down with him. He realized it was closing time.

"You didn't eat. Was something wrong with it?"

"No, no, not at all. Sorry."

"You seem a bit down."

"Yeah, sorry, and I'm sitting here while you're trying to close up."

"Don't worry about it."

"No, no, I'll get going."

"What's the matter?"

Ty pushed the plate away. "I called him twice. He didn't pick up."

"Maybe he's sleeping."

"Yeah. Probably." Ty rubbed his face. "I don't know what I'm doing. This whole thing is stupid."

Ana wiped down the counter near his booth. "Why stupid?" 

"This whole thing. I'm sure he's going to wake up one day, if he already hasn't,  and realize he made a mistake." Ty laughed, but it came out hollow. "And the worst part? I knew better. I absolutely fucking knew better."

"I've got nothing to offer. Hell, he went to college in Japan. His parents own businesses. And me? I dropped out and sling dirt for a living. His ex-girlfriend probably has a master's degree and a 401k."

"So that's it? You want to convince yourself that you're nothing?"

Ty met her eyes. "I'm not wrong, though."

"You think he doesn't know you by now? What you do and who you are?"

"And what I am. And yeah, that's the problem. He knows, and he's still here." Ty shoved his phone in his pocket. He started to get up. "I'll let you close up." 

Ana crossed her arms. "You know what I think?"

"That I'm an idiot?"

"That you're scared."

Ty looked away. "Yeah, well. All of the above."

---

He walked back home and tried to get some sleep. Still no word from Ben.

The next day, after finishing some deliveries, he came back, got lunch, and decided to text Ben. "How are things?" That was short.

It wasn't until after six that a reply came. *Trying to make the next deadline.*

After they closed, he showered and thought he’d walk to Ana's, but he was feeling like shit. He decided he wasn't hungry, got halfway there, and turned around to come back. He watched some dumb movie but switched it off and managed to fall asleep.

Just before midnight on Friday, Ty woke up needing to pee. He put on his flip-flops and strolled to the john. The open lot filled with plants felt extra quiet. Back in his room, he checked his phone. Nothing. Again, no call, no text. Okay, the guy is just busy. No, that's not like him.

He grabbed a water bottle from the fridge and sat on the edge of the bed. The plastic crinkled in the quiet.

*Ty, don't call him.*

It was late. He's sleeping or working.

*And don't text him.* Ty stared at the screen until his eyes burned. Fuck it.

*Are you okay?* he typed. *Sorry, I know it's late, but I was worried.*

He watched the screen. One minute. Two.

A bubble appeared.

*Sorry. I'll call you in 20, okay?*

Ty waited. Nineteen minutes later, Ben called.

"Hey."

"Hi." Ben's voice was unrecognizable—flat, scraped raw. "Sorry I haven't called."

"It's fine. You're still working?"

"Just finished."

"You sound like shit."

"Yeah. With no sleep, this bug is not going away. I feel like crap. Look, can I call you tomorrow?"

"Okay."

Ty waited. He wanted Ben to say something else. Anything.

The silence stretched.

"Well," Ty said, throat tight. "Okay, get some sleep. Let's talk tomorrow."

"Yeah. Thanks."

Click.

Ty set the phone on the nightstand, feeling empty, discarded. That's too much. He lay back down and stared at the ceiling.

---

Saturday morning, and he was in a fog of weird-ass dreams and missing sleep. He dragged himself through the morning routine, but the slide had already begun.

He felt delusional. Stupid.

*You're a weird little freak,* gasped the voice in his head. *Screwed up and screwed over. Whose fault? Take a guess. What a cliché. Hot normal guy falls for a twink. Wakes up after a month and goes, "What the hell am I doing!" and Mr. Straight Guy heads back to normalcy. Then the closing scene where the twink puts his head in an oven.*

He sat a moment on the edge of his bed, then pulled on his boots. Once outside, he decided it was a good day to tackle the shit pile—a big mess by the back gate, the catch-all dumping ground for broken pallets and pots, busted crates, and just junk. He jumped in and began to drag it all out. He organized it all into piles so Isabella could take a look and decide: Keep. Trash. Burn.

A bit later, she showed up. "Wow. Look at you, Mr. Motivated. This looks great." She pointed to the clean lines. "All that can go. Let's keep these boards. Wow, honey, it looks so much better!” She paused, looking at his face. "You okay?"

"Sure.”

She gave him a long hug. "Okay, it's all right. Takes time. I can tell you really liked him."

Ty wiped sweat from his forehead. "I must be the most transparent guy on Earth."

"Maybe, then you're not fake. That’s wonderful, but sometimes, life runs us over like a Sherman tank.” She gave him a soft, searching look. "Oh, and yes, you should never play poker. At least not for money."

Ty managed a weak smile.

### Chapter 25

Saturday evening closing time. Ty sat on a stool at the counter, exhausted and guzzling iced tea. He opened his phone and typed *What time can we talk tonight?*

No reply came for almost an hour, then *Sorry. What about? How about tonight  after 10?*

Just that.

At 9:55 p.m., Ty sat at the formica dinette in his room. He had the laptop open and a *Learn Spanish While You Sleep!*  video played on YouTube. None of the words reached his brain.

The phone rang. "Hey."

"Hi." Ben sounded better than last night. Still tired, but the edge was gone.

"How was your day?"

"Okay. Getting through it."

"Feeling better? The flu?"

"Yeah. Pretty much." A pause. "So. What's up?"

Ty felt a flare of irritation and took a breath. He was going to have a hard time playing it cool.

"Ben, I've been wanting..." Ty stopped. "I've been thinking."

"About what?"

"About us. I’m just not sure about things. And what happens if this goes further? You know, if you have to tell people."

Ben went quiet. "Tell people what? Look, I told you, I don't care. There’s already a rumor going around the office. I don't care. I just want to focus on my work."

"Oh, okay.” Ty’s throat felt tight. “Okay. You have to focus on your work, and that's it?"

"Don't put words in my mouth."

Silence.

"Sorry. Okay." Ty’s voice shook. He hated this.

"Ty, look, I'm really tired. Can we talk about this another time?"

"Yeah, no, not another time. That's what you said last night. Let's talk about it now."

Ty gripped the phone. "I know you're thinking, *'Here he goes again, clingy child.'* But let me talk, okay? Two minutes. I wonder how this can work. I want it to. I care about you. Probably too much. But can you really handle this… handle me? I'm not a chick. At some point, you'd have to tell people—your parents, aunts, uncles, college buddies. How is that gonna work?" Ty's voice rose. "I just think you should think about what you're getting into."

"I don’t know what you’re talking about." Ben’s voice was dull. "You're getting way ahead of things. And you told me we had to go slow, now you’re saying what? I have to announce to everyone I am dating a guy? Sorry.”

"That’s not what I’m saying. That’s just one thing. There’s everything else too.”

"Ty. Enough."

"This just doesn't make sense."

"If you mean, does it make sense when you freak out every phone call? Then yeah, it doesn't."

A long silence followed.

Then Ty spoke in a hushed voice. "Fine, Ben. Okay. Sorry. Yeah. That's me. High-maintenance queer. Be careful what you sign up for."

"Ty, I didn't 'sign up' for anything.”

Ty waited for something else, but the silence felt like the answer.

"Yeah, sure, Ben. My mistake. We've got everything settled then. Good night."

Ty hung up.

He sat there, staring at the glowing red numbers on the clock: 10:14.

He was perched on a lumpy cot in a dusty room at the edge of the desert. Alone.

It felt like it was time to go. He could tell Isabella he had another gig, pack his bags, and get on a bus. She had asked him again to stay on.

"Okay, can I think about it?" But when he thought about it, he wanted to get far away—to not have to worry that this guy could just show up again.

### Chapter 26

By the next morning, he hadn’t slept much and hadn't decided anything. He just wanted to forget about it for a while. Push it out of his mind. That was something he had always been able to do. 

He reached the counter while Isabella and Maya were huddled over the computer. Maya looked up. "There you are. Is something wrong? You're always out here early. And you look like shit."

"Thanks. Same to you." Ty grabbed a pair of gloves. "I'm fine and I'm single again. Not that I was ever really un-single, I guess."

Maya's face fell. "Shit, I'm sorry. Hang in there. We love you."

"Yes, honey, hang in there. Time will heal this." Isabella came over and gave a side hug. "And I hope you stay."

Ty managed to get through the week. He ate in his room. He'd picked up a bunch of those Dinty Moore beef stew trays. Two minutes and forty-five seconds in the microwave and then eat straight from the tray. 

The planters were still not ready. There had been some problem with the wood. Some of it warped and he needed to order more. 

The days passed. He kept busy in the nursery. And he studied online and went through some of Isabella’s botanical books. He was planting some new varieties of grasses and shrubs.

Isabella had installed a new AC unit in his room. It was marvelous—a quiet hum that drowned out the silence of his phone. He used the radio just tuned to static for some white noise that usually allowed him to sleep through Mike's early morning performances. Yes, Mike was back.

He woke to a text from Ben sent the night before. How are you? How's it going?

He stared at the screen, then deleted it. He could stick to his decision and push off from the stupid  hope that flickered when Ben's name appeared.

He managed to keep his mind on other things. Work. Plants. The rhythm of watering and pruning and seeing the seeds sprout and take hold.

He was back to heading to Ana's for dinner most nights. He'd watch whatever was on the wall mounted TV and Ana had let him help in the kitchen, doing dishes and mopping up. 

Charles had texted him. Of course Charles knew about the breakup. "I'm here if you want to talk. And you should come out with us some night. We'll have drinks. It would be therapeutic."

Ty had replied. "Thank you, Charles. Maybe sometime. I'll let you know."

He still thought about whether to stay or go. He hadn't started looking, but if he did, maybe he'd try for Vegas. Or the coast. But a big part of him wanted to stay. He'd adapted to the heat, and where else would he feel like he had a family? He loved these three women—kind and fun. He even liked the accommodations despite the lack of a view and the petrol smell.

But the other part, the broken part, wanted to flee.

Finally, on a Monday, almost the end of July, the carpenter said the planters were finished. He brought them over and unloaded them. They looked nice. He considered sending photos to Ben, then changed his mind. Isabella had emailed him that they should be ready by the end of the week.

Working with Isabella, Ty could begin the planting, starting with the liners and layers of gravel, then three types of soil, organic fertilizer. Isabella gave him lots of pointers. By Thursday, they were ready.

"I sent Ben an email that we can deliver them tomorrow." Isabella said. "You don't have to go. Just stay here with me. Maya can help Miguel."

Maya nodded, cracking her knuckles. "Sure. And I'll punch him in the face when I get there."

Ty paused. "Come on. He's fine. Anyway, no. I'll go. It's my project. I should finish it."

Later that day, Ben texted. *I saw the email. They’re ready! Yes, I'll be home tomorrow. Let me know what time.*

Ty stared at the screen and decided on a fib. *Isabella will let you know. Miguel and a helper will bring them.*

A minute later: *Ty, I was hoping I'd see you.*

Ty grimaced at the text. *This Fucker.*

### Chapter 27

Finally it was August.

Ty looked out across the nursery yard. Ben’s planters sat by the front gate, now ready, adorned with beautiful flowers and native desert plants. He wanted them gone. Out of sight. Out of his life. Let them sit on that guy’s balcony. He’ll forget to water them, and they’ll be dead in a month. Miguel had pulled the flatbed up to the front, and they lifted them on and secured them, along with two dollies,  with straps. Half past eight, they were ready and headed out.

Ty had never been to Ben's place. He’d seen pictures of the condo and the building. It was modern—smooth stucco, asymmetrical balconies with curved corners and edges that kept with the pueblo motif.

They parked at the delivery entrance. Ty wrestled the dolly down the ramp. They could only fit two planters at a time in the freight elevator.

When the elevator doors opened on the fourth floor, Ben’s door stood open.

"Hello?" Ty called out, knocking on the frame.

Ben emerged from the kitchen. He looked thinner; his hair was longer. He looked like he was just out of the shower.

"Hi there!" Ben smiled, but it didn't reach his eyes. He walked straight up to Ty and hugged him.

It was excruciating. Ty stood stiff as a board, arms at his sides, conscious of the sweat and dirt on his shirt. Miguel watched, blinking.

Ben pulled back, waving to Miguel. "Hello! Come on in, guys. Can I get you water? Anything?"

"No, we're good," Ty said, his voice flat. "We've got some cardboard we’ll put down to protect your floor, then we’ll just roll them through."

"Sure. Can I help?"

"We've got it."

Ben hovered. He vibrated with nervous energy, shifting his weight from foot to foot.

*So this is it,* Ty thought. *Going for being extra cool around an ex.*

He and Miguel made three trips. The planters were heavy—two hundred pounds of wood frame, rocks, and soil. Ty positioned them carefully, lining them up along the railing.

Twenty minutes later, they were set. Ty stepped back, wiping his forehead. They looked good.

Ben walked out onto the balcony. "Wow."

"That's it then. Let Isabella know if you have any issues."

"Ty, they look great."

"Thanks. Thank you for the business." Ty turned to the door. "Let us know if there is anything else."

"Ty?"

Ty stopped.

"Can we talk?"

"I need to get back to work."

Ben exhaled, running a hand through his hair. Ty looked at Miguel. "Can you go ahead? I'll be down in a minute."

Miguel nodded and headed to the elevator.

Ty turned to Ben. "So. What's up?"

"I want to talk to you."

"Okay, talk."

"Come on, Ty. I mean for more than a minute. I can give you a ride back to work."

Ty scowled. "That’s dumb. Just make it another time, okay?"

"Tonight?"

"Ben, look. I assume this isn't about keeping your plants alive. Let's just leave things how they are. I can't keep going around about this. I'm going to be leaving soon anyway. It's better this way."

"What do you mean, you're leaving soon?"

"I was only hired for three months."

"Ty, no. Look. Just listen. Please. Hear me out. After that, do what you want. Make up your own mind. But let me talk."

Ty looked down. They picked up the cardboard, but his grimy boots were leaving bits of mud on the polished marble floor.

He gave a bitter laugh. "Sorry. I’m leaving a mess."

Ben stepped into his space.

"Ben, no. What are you doing?" Ty held up a hand and backed away. "Okay. Fine. Look, I gotta go. Come by after work. Tonight."

Ben nodded. "Yes."

---

By 7:30 p.m., Ty had showered and tried without success to get all the dirt from his fingernails.

*Here,* Ben texted.

Ty walked out to the truck and climbed in.

"Okay," Ty said, staring out the windshield. "Look. I would really appreciate it if we stuck to our decision. Make it easy for me, okay?"

"Okay. But I don't agree that it was ever 'our' decision." Ben gripped the steering wheel. "I know I made a mess of things. Getting tied up with work and everything, I have no excuse. But I haven't really talked to you since Denver. And I’ve had a lot of time to think. And things with work are finally better now."

"Good to hear, Ben."

"That sounded patronizing."

"I don't know what that means." Ty kept his gaze forward.

"Okay. Yeah. I say dumb stuff. The wrong thing at the wrong time." Ben turned in his seat. "Ty. I've been thinking about you, about being with you."

"Come on, Ben. It's not that simple."

"Isn't it?"

Ben reached for Ty's hand.

"You know, it feels like you're fucking with me right now?" Ty snapped.

Ben went quiet. He just looked at Ty, eyes searching. The silence stretched for a long minute.

"Ben, what?"

"I want to be with you. There's no one like you."

Ty stared at his hands in his lap. Ben reached over again. This time, Ty leaned away, pressing himself against the door.

Ty’s voice cracked. "Ben, I'm really tired, okay? I don't even know where I am right now."

"You’re right here. With me. Can I be with you?”

Ty’s shoulders hunched over, and Ben’s hand was now over Ty’s.

Ty whispered back. "I never *not* wanted to be with you, asshole."

Ty's throat ached. He couldn't stop the trembling. "God damn it, you don't play fair!"

Ben leaned over.

This time, Ty grabbed his face softly and let him move in.

Ben's arms wrapped around him. When their faces touched, Ben's cheek was wet. Ty reached up, touching the damp skin. He exhaled, the fight draining out of him, and kissed him.

Ben pulled him closer. Ty pressed his palms against Ben's chest, feeling the heartbeat.

"If you leave again," Ty whispered against his mouth, "I'll kill your begonias."

"Understood."

They stayed like that, Ty's face buried in Ben's neck.

"You're still a jerk," Ty mumbled, his whole chest occasionally shook, and Ben just held him tighter.

Ben spoke now. "I'm sorry. I'll never hurt you again."

In a moment, Ty convulsed and pushed Ben away. Startled, with a wet laugh. "Shit! You crazy man! You'll never hurt me again? You are *so* full of shit. You hurt me just when you breathe." Now the tension snapped, and he grabbed Ben's shoulders and punched his chest—soft, rhythmic thuds that relieved the moment.

Ben squirmed. "Hey, stop! That tickles!"

"Nope. Not stopping." Ty straightened up a moment, his hair a mess, and mimicking Ben’s voice. *"Ty, I’m never gonna hurt you again...!"* He shook his head. "So full of shit. You’re ridiculous! Just like always."

He moved back into Ben's arms.

They sat in the dark cab for a long time. Every few minutes, a single car flew by.

"I want coffee," Ty murmured. "Would you invite me over for coffee?"

"It’s Folger's?"

"Perfect."

### Chapter 28

The next morning was one of those 'morning after' fade ins, where rays of sunlight sparkled through the trees and their leaves swayed in the breeze. If one were standing outside, there would be the smell of lavender and the music of songbirds. But neither Ty nor Ben was available. This perfect outdoors remained oblivious to their seismic shifts and tidal waves.

And buyer's remorse? No, not at all. 

Ty sat at the big island in Ben's kitchen, wrapped in a bathrobe three sizes too big. The bright morning light streamed through full glass windows while Ben fixed eggs at the stove. The coffee maker gave out a few final hisses and pops. Ben shut off the stove and plated the eggs, poured two cups and went over to Ty.

“So I finally get my coffee.”

“That’s not my fault.”

“Oh, okay, Sherlock. Already starting with the blame game. Let me know when you turn up the perp.” Ty wrapped his hands around the warm mug and gazed out at the balcony. "They turned out nice."

Ben turned to look. "Yes, awesome."

"And you're going to water them?"

"That's why you're here."

Ty laughed, sitting up. "Oh, I see! Yes! You just needed somebody to keep your begonias alive. And you, you evil bastard, you were willing to seduce a poor, defenseless…. what, what am I?  anyway, all as part of your diabolic plan!”

Ben feigned shock, hand to his chest. "Okay, wait. Can we at least agree on something? Who was the seducer and who was the seduced?"

"It was a tie, okay. Too close to call. There will be a re-match. Anyway, it's all on my body cam.”

Ben shook his head, returning to the stove. "You live in your own little world."

"And it's a lovely place. Would you like to come and visit?"

Ben just shook his head and had a bite of his eggs. 

Ty scooped up several bites. He watched Ben as he ate, the line of Ben’s back, his hair now longer, and the way he stood. Ty just shut his eyes for a moment. This was too perfect. He should be scared, but he didn’t care. He spoke up. "Hey, how have your parents been? You said your dad had to go for some tests."

"Yeah, well, he's almost seventy, right? So he needs to stay on top of things. He went to a urologist. The results came back, and everything was fine. He’s good. They’re good. And my mom says hi."

Ty's eyes went wide and he stammered. "What?"

"My mom said hi."

"Ben. You're kidding. Your mom knows?"

"What do you mean? Of course. I told her a while ago."

Ty’s brain short-circuited. "Told her what? Like *'Hey Mom, I met this nice girl. She’s a bit ‘different.’ She lives in a warehouse and wears pants and pees standing up. She’s got kind of a deep voice. And big hands and an Adam’s apple, but she's from a nice Baptist family, prays every day, tries to pray it away... but she's sharp, got a full ride to Yale, straight A's, straight teeth... just wait until you meet her. And she can go topless at the pool!'*"

Ben sighed, plating the eggs. "You belong on stage. But yes, I told her."

Ty stared at him. "Have you lost your mind? How will your nice, straight, conservative, white, Protestant, suburban yuppie parents handle the idea of you being with... *me*?" Ty hissed that last word.

"My parents are none of those things. Ahem, well, mostly. I told them about you last month. It was a surprise, sure. My dad is not saying much. That’s fine. He’ll work through it. But it’s fine."

Ty slumped on the stool. "I don't believe you."

"Okay." Ben pulled out his phone. "Let's FaceTime them."

"Oh yeah. Great idea. Frisky little me right here in your bathrobe—with that  boom-boom glow."

“Boom-boom? You’re amazing. Anyway, I'll just tell her you're the gardener, and you got dirty. It's the truth."

"I like that. Can I use that? Charles will ask me, ‘Ty, how was your evening?’ ‘Lovely, Charles, but a little messy.’” Ty sipped his coffee. “Anyway, sure, let’s call your mom.”

Ben brought the coffee pot over to refill Ty's mug. "You never stop."

Ty scooted his stool forward. "I'm not planning to. Now put down the coffee before someone gets burned.” His robe slipped open and off his shoulder. He reached his out and pulled Ben in.

Thirty minutes later, the bedroom was quiet. Ben had fallen asleep, his arm over his head, covering his eyes. Ty carefully untangled himself and checked the time: 7:30.

Shit, I'm late. He texted Isabella. *Sorry! I'm on my way.*

A text came right back. *Are you okay?*

He replied, *Very okay.*

*Then take the day off.*

### Chapter 29

Ty had fallen back asleep with Ben lying next to him, his own quiet breathing. But now he was resurfacing, waking up but not knowing what or where. He never slept in and it felt late. This wasn't his place. It wasn't his squeaky bunk. No dark plywood ceiling over him. Instead, this was a large gorgeous room of dark floor to ceiling curtains along both walls, It was dim and pleasant and the smell of chemicals was missing. He rolled over and found his phone on the nightstand. Yep, it was after ten but at least the phone showed "AM". He stretched and shook himself, got up and pulled back the curtain. A view of the park and downtown.

He threw on his top and wandered out. Ben was on the balcony with his laptop. He looked up when Ty slid the glass door open.

"A second good morning," Ty said.

"Yes. You okay?"

"Of course. I’m going to shower, then breakfast."

"Definitely."

They walked down to a spot a few blocks away. The morning air was already warming up. Ty ordered French toast and a side of bacon. Ben asked for an omelet. When the food arrived, they didn't talk much. They just ate. The plates were clean within ten minutes.

Ty pulled his phone out. There was a message from Isabella.

*Don't come to work tomorrow. We're not that busy.*

Ty stared at the screen. *We aren't busy.* That wasn’t the real reason. But it was fine. More than fine.

He put the phone in his pocket. "I have tomorrow off."

Ben nodded. "Really? That’s great. And I’m taking Monday off. We have two days."

They stopped at a grocery store and headed back to the condo. Ty spent the afternoon on the balcony tending to the plants. He watered them, mixed in some fresh potting soil, and checked the bottom of the containers. The drainage holes were clear.

Ben sat at the small patio table. He finished up some emails and took a break. Ty was kneeling next to one of the low cylinders and felt the gaze. He turned.

"What?"

"Nothing." Ben’s lip curled.

"I felt you looking at me."

"Yeah? I’ve always wondered... how does that work?"

"I don’t know either, but stop it."

"Make me."

"I will, punk."

By evening, Ty settled on the couch with his sketchpad. Ben finished up his work at the kitchen table. Ty got up to start dinner. He boiled water for rice noodles and added sliced pork and veggies.

Ty called his mom. She picked up on the second ring. Her voice was raspy, but she laughed when he asked about her garden. She sounded lighter than she had in weeks. He was just checking in. He gave some updates about work and asked how Aunt Maggie was doing. He didn't mention Ben. It seemed too new, almost like a hallucination.

The next morning, they slept past nine. Ty felt like he didn't know what day it was. Ben made scrambled eggs and toast, and they ate on the balcony. The heat hadn't kicked in yet.

They stayed in and streamed a couple of old movies—Ty's pick—and Ben fell asleep halfway through the second one. Ty covered him in a blanket and lowered the sound.

Around six, they wanted food and decided to walk to the sushi place. Ty was getting better with the chopsticks. Ben ordered too much, but they took the leftovers home.

Back at the condo, Ty curled up against Ben on the couch. Ben was back on his laptop. The TV was on, mute. It was an ocean documentary and the underwater images were putting Ty to sleep.

On Monday, they packed a small cooler and drove north up Interstate 10. It took an hour to reach the cut-off for Ironwood. It was Ty's first time heading into the foothills.

The landscape opened up. It was dry and sprawling. The sun beat down on the hard ground. They hiked a trail that climbed along a ridge. At the top, the view spread out to the horizon. Saguaros rose from the scrub. Some stood straight, while others had heavy arms bent at sharp, odd angles.

Ben pointed to a cluster of dark rocks. "Over there."

They walked closer. Faint lines marked the stone surface. Petroglyphs. Ty saw a spiral carved into the rock. There was a figure of a deer near the bottom.

Ty traced the shape of the spiral with his eyes. It was quiet up here. The wind moved through the brush. He looked at Ben, who was studying the horizon. Ty stood next to him. Their arms brushed. Ty didn't pull away. He wanted to say something about how good this felt, being out here where no one knew them, but he just leaned his weight slightly against Ben's shoulder.

They sat for a while with snacks and iced tea. The heat pressed down, but the air felt clean.

By the time they got back to the truck, the sun was low. The western half of the sky was streaked with puffs of red and orange. The kind of sunset you’d never see in Syracuse.

They stopped at Ana's for dinner on the way back. The diner was quiet. Ana was sitting at the counter. She smiled, got up, and came over to them.

"Finally," Ana said. "You remembered to come and see me! Together. You two look like you’ve been on a trek."

"We have. We went up to Ironwood."

"Nice! What are you having?"

"A thousand enchiladas, please."

"That’s going to take a while."

"How about two orders then."

They sat and chatted after they ate, then drove back to the condo. The hiking and the sun had worn them out. They showered, hit the pillows, and were out.

A bit later, Ty got up to use the bathroom. When he returned, he slipped in next to Ben and pulled the covers up. The room was dark. He listened to Ben breathing beside him. He closed his eyes and saw the rocks at Ironwood—with drawings of spirals and figures, marks that had survived more time than can even be imagined.

### Chapter 30

Tuesday, the next day, Ben dropped Ty off at the nursery. He walked over to the counter where Maya was busy on the computer. 

She looked up and smiled. "Well, well, well. What have we here?"

“Good morning. And don't start.” 

Maya tipped her head. “Aw, I've missed you. Come here, give me a hug. I brought you coffee. So anything new? Any news to share? Comings and goings? Revelations? Rug burns?”

“You're funny.” 

“Come on! I need something. Are you still friends?” Maya crossed her arms and settled on the stool next to him.

“You get nothing, zero.” 

“Aw, you're no fun.”

“I’ve heard that.” 

“Not from Ben, I bet." She grabbed her coffee. "Does he like the planters?"

"Of course. They look nice on the balcony. I'll take pictures."

Ty was happy to be back at work, and the day was nice. He made good progress and finished up all the re-planting.

Ben got there before closing, and they all sat and chatted for a bit.

Maya teased him. “So, are you going to write us a nice review? How about: 'They have great plants and amazing personal service! They'll even spend the night if you buy them dinner. And do all your weeding.” She laughed.

Ty turned on the stool so his back was to Maya, and spoke just to Ben and Isabella. "Let's ignore her."

---

There was never an actual date, discussion, or decision about him moving in. He and Ben never had an official "should we live together" discussion. They didn't seem to need those sorts of talks.

After a week, Isabella asked Ty if he wanted to keep the room. It was fine with her and Ty said yes, that he'd prefer to have it "just in case". Being with Ben was so new and also, he knew it was a big change for both of them.

And as far as Ty's worldly possessions, no u-Haul was required. He moved in with a matter of a duffel bag and two pairs of work boots.

And during the week, for dinner and breakfast, they already had a routine. Ben would cook, and Ty would clean up. They even had a regular nightly exchange.

Ben would ask, as Ty finished with the dishes, "Do you want to spend the night?"

Ty stand there and reflect. "I'm not sure, Ben. I guess I could, but there's only one bed so I'll sleep on the sofa."

"No, Ty, sleep in my bed."

"But remember that thing that happened? That one night? And anyway, I feel like a refugee."

"That's okay." Ben nodded.

Ty laughed. "Hey, you're supposed to say 'Oh no, no, you're the Prince of Persia who has escaped from her harem.'"

Ben seemed perplexed. "Princes don't live in harems. I think you have some wires crossed up here." He came close and pointed his finger at Ty's forehead.

Ty stared back. "Perhaps. You are clearly too tied to the facts. And I'm concerned about a power shift in our relationship."

"Yes, you're nuts so you have it all." 

---

Ty talked to his mom all the time now. She sounded better. She'd separated from his father and was living with her aunt in Albany.

"I'm happy for you, sweetheart," she said one night. "You sound different."

"I am different."

"Good different."

"Yeah." He paused. "I met someone."

"Tell me."

He did. She listened without interrupting, and when he finished, she said, "I'd like to meet him."

"I hope so. It's all kinda scary right now."

At work, Ty had accepted Isabella's offer to stay on. It was not a hard decision. One morning, she walked over to him as he filled some pots. "Honey, it's going to work, you and Ben. You're both good people. I can tell. And he's happy with you."

She gave him a hug.

Ty looked up and smiled. "Thanks."

"You're welcome." She squeezed his hand. "We got three deliveries today."

"Oh man." Ty groaned. "So you say something so nice and then follow up with that?"

"Of course. But I also brought some tamales."

The month of August went by. Ben joked that Ty had arrived with the planters. And they were beautiful—and thriving—but if he had to choose? "Well, let me think about it."

---

On Labor Day, Charles threw them a party at his studio. He announced to everyone that it was Ben and Ty's reception, which was so Charles. Ben looked annoyed. Ty worried it was a jinx. But the night passed with music and laughter, no disaster. There were so many new people who were kind and happy. Charles even brought out a cake adorned with large figurines: King Kong—and Godzilla in a dress—before a backdrop of Tokyo.

### Chapter 31

Later in September, Ty and Ben flew to San Diego. Ty thought it was too soon to "meet the family". And Ben had hesitated at first, but he hadn't seen them in a year, and he wasn't going to go without Ty.

Ty hated the airport: the lines, security, being zoned and then stuffed into the plane. And people would look at them. He wanted to rest his head on Ben's shoulder, but no way. So he tried to act like they were just buddies, and that didn't really seem to work either. Probably, he just needed to "rise above" as Isabella would say.

Ty was already best friends with Lilly, Ben's mom. They chatted all the time on FaceTime. When he got there, she hugged him and asked him a million questions. They went to her shop on the weekend, and she explained to him all about fabrics and antiques. She fixed too much food. One night, they were all in the kitchen, drinking wine, and she showed them how to cook a beef stew.

At first, Ben's dad was very quiet. "That's just how he is," Ben told him.

"Your dad looks at me like I'm an alien," Ty whispered one evening as they sat together.

"Yeah, but you *are* an alien, from the planet Maroon," Ben whispered back. "Seriously, don't worry about it. That's just how he is: the stoic Asian man. Trust me—if he didn't like you, you'd feel his invisible death ray peeling your skin off. Remember two nights ago? When he came in here and sat and watched the movie with us? I couldn’t believe it."

In the backyard of his parents' house, there was a big garden. They had long vine beans, lots of shrub vegetables, herbs, and wildflowers. His dad grew the vegetables, and his mom took care of the herbs and flowers.

Just a couple of days before they left, Ben's dad asked Ty for some advice on planting tomatoes. They went outside together to take a look, and Ben's father was interested and gracious. Ben came out and joined them, and they stood and talked for a while.

Later, Ben told Ty that it was a big deal. "He's okay with you."

### Chapter 32

It was Saturday, October 4 and it was his birthday. He was twenty-one. 

He strolled into the kitchen right at six-thirty, dressed for work.

"Happy Birthday," Ben said standing at the stove. "As of today, you're a grown-up."

"And you're no longer boinking a minor."

"You were never a minor," Ben handed him a travel mug. "I know the law."

"I bet you do." Ty leered, then strolled over to give Ben a cheek kiss and sidled up next to him at the counter.

“By the way, any regrets?”

Ben was puzzled. "About what?"

“Remember, you said you were thinking about getting a dog, but now something else has moved in."

“Sure, yes, some ‘thing’. Okay, I hadn’t thought about that.” Ben now knew the routine. "Is it too late for me to reconsider?"

"Well, I'm just asking. You could have gotten a cute little Poodle-Doo, but you ended up with me. So? Any regrets?

“You betcha. Every night and especially mornings. Like this one." He paused a moment. "And I'm gonna guess you're got some crude joke ready about doggies and four legs versus two. Spare me this time. It's too early."

"You don't have to worry. The old Ty has retired. As of today, I am changing my ways. No more of my inappropriate wit. I regret all of it, everything." He waltzed over and gave Ben a quick peck.

"Can't you just take the day off? It's your birthday." Ben asked. "We could sit by the pool. Or take a drive."

"I need to work. I already had two weeks off when we went to San Diego. I got bills to pay. And rent."

"You don't pay rent."

"Sure I do. Otherwise, I'd be a kept boy and I'd have to call you sugar daddy. What would the neighbors think? Anyway, I am saving up to buy you a new truck. One of those American beast machines." 

He paused a moment and took a sip from the thermos. "The coffee is yummy. You're a marvelous little homemaker. Someday you'll make some little lady very happy." Ty pondered a moment. "That's it! For Christmas, you're getting a nice frilly cook's apron. Charles and I will go shopping."

"Get out of here."

"See you tonight. You said we'd meet Charles at the restaurant?"

"Yes. I'll get there at closing and bring you clothes. Wear your helmet."

"Yes, Mom."

"I could just give you a ride, you know." Ben poured himself coffee. "Then you wouldn't have to leave the scooter there."

"It's fine. Monday, I'll take the bus."

"No. Monday, I'll drive you."

"Yes, my duke." Ty bowed.

Ben nodded a moment. "Duke? and then 'boss, dear, my Lord, Mom, and snookums'? You have a lot of names for me."

"Oh, you have no idea." Ty began to back down the hallway. "I have an endless supply that could last a long time. And then a whole other bunch, the ones I whisper to you in the other room as we..." A long pause then Ty pretended to have a realization: "Shit! Wait! You're not really paying much attention right then, are you?"

"Bye!" And he was out the door before Ben could stop him.
